//! `engined` — the engine process: spawned, handed a secret, talked to, and killed. `session.attach`
//! opens the named log, scans it at full speed and follows it live.
//!
//! No game logic lives here. `eqlog` owns what an event and a line are, `fold` owns the fold that
//! turns events into state, and it reaches this crate through one trait, [`ingest::EventSink`]. This
//! crate owns the process, the protocol, and the question of who is folding.
//!
//! The spawn contract, binding and shared with the supervisor:
//!
//! 1. No secrets in argv or env — argv is world-readable and an environment block is readable by
//!    anything that can open the process. The first line on stdin is the token.
//! 2. The engine binds `127.0.0.1:0` and prints exactly one line to stdout:
//!    `EQC-ENGINE PORT=<port> PROTOCOL=<protocolVersion>`, flushed. Nothing else ever goes to
//!    stdout — it is a machine channel with one reader and one message on it. Diagnostics go to
//!    stderr.
//! 3. The engine exits 0 promptly when stdin reaches EOF. The pipe closes when the parent's handles
//!    close however it ended, which is the only mechanism that cannot lie: no orphan mode, no PID
//!    file, no heartbeat to forget to send.
//! 4. Every TCP connection opens with a valid `hello` or is closed. The port authenticates nobody;
//!    the token authenticates everybody.
//! 5. A respawn is a launch: fresh token, fresh epoch, fresh world. Resume is always re-query.
//!
//! Two exit codes, and no third. `0` is the contract's own ending. `1` is a refusal to start: no
//! token on stdin, a token that cannot be one, or a loopback socket that would not bind. Everything
//! else this process can meet is connection-level, and closes a connection rather than the process.
