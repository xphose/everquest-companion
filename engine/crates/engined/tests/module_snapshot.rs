//! The fold serves, over a real socket, against the real binary: `module.snapshot` for every module
//! in the registry, a mid-scan snapshot that is a real prefix state, `notFound` and `unavailable` as
//! two different sentences, and `session.health`'s mark and its four optional fields.
//!
//! The oracle is a second fold of the same bytes rather than the recorded TypeScript, because the
//! claim is self-consistency: the path a request travels — socket, ops table, channel, ingest
//! thread, registry — hands back what the fold in that thread actually holds. Fold semantics are
//! `npm run oracle:rust-fold`'s job.
//!
//! `construction_now_ms` is the one construction input the oracle cannot match (the engine's attach
//! instant against this test's `now`). Only `respawn` reads it, so `respawn` is compared for shape
//! and every other module in `WIRING_ORDER` is compared whole.
