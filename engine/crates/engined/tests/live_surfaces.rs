//! The things a live engine says without being asked, and the commands it answers.
//!
//! Every claim here is one the fold's own unit tests cannot make, because each is about the boundary
//! between the ingest thread and a connection thread while a tail is watching a file:
//!
//!   * `world.conCard` — a `/con` the game wrote a moment ago becomes a resolved card frame, and a
//!     historical con reaches none of it;
//!   * `sessionMarks.add` — refused while the fold is replaying, taken once it is live;
//!   * `respawn.confirmSighting` — re-bases one respawn clock onto the sighting the log made, a
//!     write crossing the same thread boundary a define does;
//!   * `moduleChanged` — the dirty bit, at the serve cadence, naming a module whose cursor moved.
//!
//! The log is written line by line, because a claim about what one line did needs a log whose every
//! event is known, dated after the launch anchor so the rebirth boundary fires on the zone line.
