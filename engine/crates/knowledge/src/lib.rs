//! The process-pinned wiki corpora, engine-side, plus the bundled Plane of Sky dataset,
//! indexed once and queried on demand behind `knowledge.item/mob/spell/search`.
//!
//! THE WIKI FETCH IS NOT HERE. The engine ships without a network stack, so resolution is:
//!
//!   1. the committed corpus, which answers the overwhelming majority and short-circuits the rest;
//!   2. the runtime overlay — answers the app has already fetched and pushed back with
//!      `knowledge.define`;
//!   3. a MISS, recorded here, drained at a boundary and announced as a `knowledgeMiss` frame. The
//!      app fetches under its own scrape throttle and cooldown, and pushes the answer in.
//!
//! Each name is announced AT MOST ONCE per process: a stacked loot burst probes one name many times
//! and the app must not be asked to fetch it many times.
//!
//! The selected wiki pack is verified before startup; indexes remain lazy. Embedded bytes
//! provide the offline fallback only when the app has not selected a cached generation.
//!
//! `knowledge.spell` answers off `eqlog`'s effective spell DB and states exactly the fields that DB
//! carries. It deliberately does NOT carry the derived effect classes, the rank lineage or the
//! focus/level-dependent metrics: those need inputs this engine does not have, and half a card is a
//! wrong answer wearing a right one's clothes. A named gap, stated in the schema beside the op.
