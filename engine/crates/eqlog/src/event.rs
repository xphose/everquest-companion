//! The event writer: a JSON object built key by key in the order the app's object literal states
//! it, and the same event as a typed payload built in the same pass.
//!
//! The JSON is not a `serde` enum because the bar is byte identity with `JSON.stringify`, which
//! writes insertion order — a property of the code path, not of the kind. `damage` alone is written
//! four different ways, a field set to `undefined` disappears, and `group` puts `change` ahead of
//! `seq`/`ts`/`raw` where every other kind puts them first. A derived struct per kind would have to
//! be a struct per branch, with the ordering claim far from the branch that makes it. So a
//! classifier writes its fields in the same sequence its counterpart lists them, and the two can be
//! read side by side.
//!
//! [`Payload`] is those same writes recorded as data: the kind as a discriminant, each field as a
//! `(Key, Slot)` pair in write order. The fold reads it; re-parsing the NDJSON string back into a
//! `serde_json::Value` cost 9.6% of a whole fold. The string is still written because it is the
//! parser oracle's byte-identity artifact.
//!
//! It allocates nothing per event: every string a field carries goes into one reused arena and is
//! referred to by an `(offset, length)` pair, and every side table is a reused `Vec` cleared by
//! [`Ev::begin`].
//!
//! Absent is not null, and the writer is where that distinction is made. `s_opt`/`i_opt` push no
//! entry at all; `s_or_null`/`i_or_null` push [`Slot::Null`]. A reader that collapses the two must
//! be able to tell them apart first — `buffFade.target` absent means self, which is a different
//! claim from a `target` of nothing.
//!
//! Keys are first-wins on lookup, and no classifier writes a key twice: a repeated key would print
//! twice in the NDJSON, which `JSON.stringify` over an object literal cannot produce. [`Ev::note`]
//! carries a `debug_assert` so a classifier that repeats one fails a debug test rather than
//! shifting a lookup silently.
