//! Which modules announce, and on what — the under-announce proof, per module.
//!
//! Over-announcing on a real subset is honest; under-announcing loses UI updates and is the one
//! failure direction not allowed. A test that only checked the silence half would be satisfied by a
//! module that never announces at all, so every migrated module gets both claims: one representative
//! mutating event per arm family moves its cursor, and a line that is none of its business does not.
//!
//! The instrument is `Registry::published_seqs`, which is what `Serving::changed_modules` reads on
//! the serve beat — so this is the dirty bit itself, asked one event at a time.
//!
//! The input is JSON events rather than log lines, because a claim about what one arm does needs an
//! event whose every field is known. `engined`'s `tests/live_surfaces.rs` makes the same claim from
//! the other end, over a real socket with real EQ lines.
