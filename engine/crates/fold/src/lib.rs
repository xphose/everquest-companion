//! The module fold: the `EqModule` contract, a registry that preserves wiring order, and one
//! ported module per file under `modules/`.
//!
//! Parity with the TypeScript is deep equality, not byte identity — array order, numbers and which
//! keys exist are claims; key order is not, and a field the TS wrote as `undefined` must be absent
//! rather than `null`.
//!
//! Delivery is dispatch, observe, drain: a primary event reaches every listener in registration
//! order, and anything a listener derived is queued and drained afterwards through the same loop.
//!
//! No module reads a wall clock; it is handed one through [`Fold::tick`], which only the live tail
//! calls. Every other time-based rule advances off log timestamps, so a fold of the same bytes
//! stays a pure function of those bytes. All state lives behind the registry — no statics, no
//! caches keyed by anything but a fold's own inputs, nothing outliving a `Fold`.
