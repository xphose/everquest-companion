//! The ported modules. One file per `src/main/modules/*.ts`, named after it, each stating its TS
//! twin's design rules rather than pointing at them.
//!
//! `combo` and `resist` each have a directory beside them, mirroring their TS twin's own factoring:
//! a shell over pure siblings. Exactly one `EqModule` impl per subtree either way.
//!
//! The `buff*` files stay flat rather than becoming a directory, so this crate's layout matches the
//! folder their TS twins share. `buffs.rs` and `buff_timers.rs` hold one `EqModule` each and share
//! their cast anchors and their learner.
