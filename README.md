# EQ Legends Companion

A Windows desktop companion for **EverQuest Legends**. It reads the log file the game
already writes and turns it into live, useful views — a DPS meter, floating overlays,
quest and loot tracking, alerts.

**It reads game logs, character exports, and your live map position.** The Maps tab
uses read-only process access for your own character's position on supported game
versions. Nothing is injected, no game files or memory are changed, and nothing is
played for you. Turn off **Live location** in Maps to stop position reads.
Log-based tracking needs logging; the offline quest directory can be browsed without it.

## What it does

- **Live DPS meter** — per-fight and per-zone numbers with fight history, drill-down
  into each attack and spell, and a timeline of the pull.
- **Floating overlays** — small always-on-top meters you can leave on top of the game:
  damage or healing, scoped to the current fight or the whole zone. Lock one and it
  becomes click-through.
- **Plane of Sky tracker** — every class's Test quests with "have / need" chips per
  item, item stats on hover, and sorting by closest-to-done.
- **Expanded quest journal** — quest discovery, recorded task history, pickup and
  monster locations, turn-in guides, and reward comparisons for your character.
  Progress follows readable game evidence automatically. See the
  [journal guide](docs/quest-journal.md) for setup and coverage.
- **Live map navigation** — a moving player marker, automatic current-zone maps,
  and optional centering while you travel. Manual map picks stay pinned until you
  choose **Current zone** or **Center on me**. See the [map guide](docs/live-map.md).
- **Loot + item knowledge** — a running history of what you looted, and what each item
  is actually *for*: which quests use it, what it turns in for, which recipes consume it.
- **Leveling & AA** — XP and AA progress per character, with history.
- **Raid targets** — which named/raid mobs you've killed and when.
- **Buff timers** — remaining time on buffs, learned from the log *(early — still rough)*.
- **Sound alerts** — play a sound when something happens: a charm break, a buff fading,
  a raid target dying, or any log line you write a rule for. Voice packs included.

Everything is per-character; switch characters and the app re-reads that log.

## Getting started

**Requires 64-bit Windows 10 or 11.** Windows 8.1 and older can't run it — the installer
checks and stops with a message rather than leaving you an app that won't start.

1. Download `everquest-companion-Setup-<version>.exe` from the
   [**Releases**](https://github.com/jmoyers/everquest-companion/releases) page.
2. Run it. It's a one-click, per-user install (like Discord) — no admin prompt, no
   wizard. It adds a Start-menu and desktop shortcut.
3. In EverQuest, type `/log on`.

The app finds your log automatically — usually
`C:\Users\Public\Daybreak Game Company\Installed Games\EverQuest Legends\Logs\`. If your
install lives somewhere else, point it at the right folder in **Settings**.

Overlays sit on top of the game in **windowed** or **borderless** mode. Exclusive
fullscreen can't be overlaid by anything, so use borderless if you want them.

### Code signing

The installer is code-signed as **Joshua Moyers** through Microsoft's Artifact
Signing service, and auto-updates are verified against that signature before they
install. If SmartScreen still shows a "Windows protected your PC" warning while
the certificate is new, click **More info**, then **Run anyway** — you only ever
see it once.

### Already have an old `eq-tools` install?

The app was renamed from `eq-tools` to `everquest-companion`, which Windows treats as a
different app — the new installer will *not* replace the old one, and the old install
will never auto-update again. Uninstall **eq-tools** once from Settings → Apps, then run
the new installer. Your settings, alerts and sound packs carry over automatically on
first launch (the old folder is left in place, untouched, as a backup).

## Updates

The app updates itself in the background from GitHub Releases. When a new version has
downloaded, an **"Update ready"** notice appears with a **Restart** button — click it to
apply now, or it installs the next time you quit.

## Make it yours

- **Sound & voice packs.** Alert sounds come from packs. One voice pack ships with the
  app and installs itself on first launch, and you can browse and install ~350 more from
  inside the app (**Alerts → Sound packs…**). To add your own: drop a folder into
  `%AppData%\everquest-companion\soundpacks\<your-pack>\` containing your `.wav`/`.mp3`/`.ogg`
  files and a small `manifest.json` naming them — it shows up in every sound picker. Want
  your own Final Fantasy fanfare on a raid kill? That's the whole job.
- **Share alerts.** Any alert (or all of them at once) copies to a short paste-safe
  string. Drop it in guild chat or Discord; whoever pastes it back in gets a preview
  before anything is added. Imports only ever *add* — they never overwrite your alerts.
- **Share your setup.** Export your whole settings bundle — alerts, volume, overlay
  look, view preferences, favorites — as one string or a file. It carries no file paths,
  no window positions, and no character progress.

## Feedback

**Send feedback** in the nav drawer (also in **Settings → Feedback**) opens a dialog with
two choices — **Feature request** or **Bug report** — and one box to type in. That box is
the only thing you fill out; there's no title field and no contact field to fill in.

A report carries exactly this:

- the type (feature or bug) and the description you typed;
- what the app knows about *itself* — app version, release channel, `win32`, your OS
  build number, CPU architecture, and the Electron/Chrome/Node versions it's running on;
- an anonymous per-install id, which exists only to rate-limit and to link your follow-up
  report to your earlier one. It's a random UUID in a file you own, tied to nothing.

**It does not contain your character name, your server, your EverQuest install path, your
Windows user name, or your machine name.** None of those are collected, and none of your
gameplay, progress, or settings ride along.

**Bug reports can attach a slice of your EverQuest log**, and this is the one place log
contents leave your machine. It's opt-in (ticked by default for bugs, and never offered
for feature requests), covers the last 15, 30, or 60 minutes, and it is **scrubbed before
you ever see it**: chat, tells, group and guild messages, and `/who` output are dropped
by the same filter that governs the log fixtures committed to this repo. Your own
character name, zones, spells, combat lines, and structural events like group joins
stay — that's what makes a bug reproducible.

The dialog shows you the slice, expanded, before you send anything: how many lines it is,
the exact time span, how many lines the scrub removed, and its compressed size. **Save a
copy…** writes every byte to a file of your choosing, so you can read the whole thing
first rather than trusting a preview. Nothing is uploaded until you press Send.

**Want a reply?** Put your email or Discord handle in the message itself. That's the only
way we'll have to reach you, and leaving it out is a perfectly normal way to file.

After a successful send you get a **report id**. It's worth keeping: quote it in a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/jmoyers/everquest-companion/issues) and we can delete
that report's log slice and any contact details you included. See
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for how long each piece is kept.

If you're offline, the report is saved and sent the next time the app runs with a working
connection.

**Anonymous usage counts.** Separately from feedback, the app sends anonymous counts —
session lengths, which views and features get used, whether an update or a voice install
worked. It's on by default and a one-line bar tells you so the first time you run it;
nothing is sent before that bar has appeared. **Opt out** there, or the switch in
**Preferences → Usage analytics**, turns it off and deletes both the buffered events and
your anonymous id on the spot. There is no free-text field in what it sends, so your
character names, zones, chat, alert names, paths and log lines cannot travel in it —
[`TELEMETRY.md`](TELEMETRY.md) lists every event and field, generated from the schema, and
the same Preferences pane shows you the exact JSON waiting to go and the last batch that
left. The id it uses is deliberately **not** your feedback install id: the two data sets
can't be joined, by us or by anyone else. [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md#usage-analytics) has
the retention details.

## Thanks

The item icons and raid-boss portraits this app draws come from two volunteer-run
EverQuest wikis — [**wiki.project1999.com**](https://wiki.project1999.com/) (boss
portraits) and [**eqlwiki.com**](https://eqlwiki.com/) (item icons, and the item, spell
and quest knowledge behind them). Those images are **copied into the app at build time**
(`resources/wiki-images/`, ~3.75 MB, regenerated with `npm run fetch:images`), so the
running app never asks either site for a picture, and
[`resources/wiki-images/manifest.json`](resources/wiki-images/manifest.json) records the
exact source URL, byte length and SHA-256 of every file it ships. Neither wiki is
affiliated with this app. The same credit is in the app itself, under
**Preferences → Thanks**.

The bundled **Alan Rickman** voice pack comes from
[utensils/openpeon-alan-rickman-soundpack](https://github.com/utensils/openpeon-alan-rickman-soundpack)
and is licensed CC-BY-4.0. Packs you install from the in-app browser carry their own
licenses and attribution (see each pack's manifest); none of them are part of this
repository.
