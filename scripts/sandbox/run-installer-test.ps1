# run-installer-test.ps1 - THE way to run the tier-2 clean-machine installer test.
# Runs on the HOST. Wraps installer-test.wsb so the whole thing is hands-off and stays
# out of the way of whatever is on the primary monitor (the user games there).
#
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\sandbox\run-installer-test.ps1
#
# What it does:
#   1. Pre-flight: force-closes any stale sandbox (only ONE Windows Sandbox instance is
#      allowed machine-wide - a leftover VM makes the next launch fail with
#      "Only one running instance of Windows Sandbox is allowed"), and verifies a
#      CURRENT installer artifact exists before booting a VM to test nothing.
#   2. Launches the .wsb, waits for the WindowsSandboxClient window, then parks it on the
#      first NON-PRIMARY monitor and pushes it to the bottom of the z-order, never
#      stealing focus (SWP_NOACTIVATE). Single-monitor machines minimize instead.
#   3. Polls for the mapped results file, then force-kills the client so teardown is
#      non-interactive (an in-guest shutdown pops a modal on the host desktop).
#   4. Prints the verdict and exits 0 on PASS, 1 on anything else.
#
# Steps 1-3 are NOT implemented here: they are the shared host-side sandbox lifecycle and live
# in sandbox-lifecycle.ps1, dot-sourced below, because run-smoke-feedback.ps1 needs exactly the
# same four behaviours and a second copy of them would be a second thing to get wrong.
#
# ASCII only (see installer-test.ps1 for why).
