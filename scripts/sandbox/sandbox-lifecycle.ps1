# sandbox-lifecycle.ps1 - the shared HOST-side Windows Sandbox lifecycle.
#
# DOT-SOURCE THIS, never run it: it defines functions and nothing else.
#
#   . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'sandbox-lifecycle.ps1')
#
# EXTRACTED VERBATIM from run-installer-test.ps1 when a SECOND harness needed the same four
# hard-won behaviours. They were learned the hard way once and there must be exactly one copy:
#
#   1. SINGLE-INSTANCE GUARD. Only ONE Windows Sandbox instance is allowed machine-wide; a
#      leftover VM makes the next launch fail with "Only one running instance of Windows
#      Sandbox is allowed". So every run force-closes a stale client first.
#   2. FORCE TEARDOWN. Both graceful paths (an in-guest shutdown, closing the window) raise a
#      modal confirmation ON THE HOST DESKTOP. The user is gaming there. Kill the process.
#   3. OFF-PRIMARY PARKING. The VM window is moved to the first NON-PRIMARY monitor and pushed
#      to the bottom of the z-order WITHOUT stealing focus (SWP_NOACTIVATE). Single-monitor
#      machines minimize instead. The primary monitor stays clear.
#   4. RE-ASSERTED PLACEMENT. The VM window likes to re-raise itself, so the results poll
#      re-parks it on every tick rather than placing it once and hoping.
#
# ASCII only. These files sit beside guest scripts that MUST be ASCII (the sandbox runs Windows
# PowerShell 5.1, which reads a BOM-less .ps1 as ANSI and dies on a stray non-ASCII byte); one
# rule for the whole folder is easier to keep than two.
