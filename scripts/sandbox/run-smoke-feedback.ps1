# run-smoke-feedback.ps1 - THE way to run the post-release END-TO-END feedback smoke test.
#
#   npm run smoke:release
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\sandbox\run-smoke-feedback.ps1
#
# ============================== ON-DEMAND ONLY ==============================
# NOT in CI. NOT in `npm test`. NOT in `npm run test:e2e`. NOT in any run-all.
# This boots a VM, downloads the PUBLISHED installer, and files a REAL bug report against the
# LIVE ingest API - a real DSQL row and a real S3 object, which it then DELETES. Run it
# deliberately, once, after a release has been published. That is the whole point of it.
# ============================================================================
#
# WHAT IT PROVES, which nothing else in this repo does: that the artifact a user actually
# downloads, installed on a machine that has never seen this project, can carry a bug report
# with an attached log slice all the way to the operator's backlog - through the shipped
# validator, the live per-install quota, the live kill switch, the presign and the bucket pin -
# AND that the slice which arrives has been scrubbed of third-party chat.
#
# THE PROOF IS A BOOBY-TRAPPED LOG. The mocked EverQuest log this script synthesizes
# (scripts/smokeLog.mts) puts the run's NONCE on every combat line and CHAT_MARKER on every
# chat line. Downstream, the slice that comes back out of S3 must contain the nonce (real
# content travelled) and must NOT contain the marker (the scrub ran). Those two facts are the
# test; everything else is plumbing that gets them there.
#
# AND A SECOND LEG, since the telemetry client was lit: the same installed build, launched
# plainly and left running for two flush ticks, must land its anonymous usage counts in the
# live tables. The guest echoes the app's own analyticsId; this script polls analytics_install
# for it plus a session counter in usage_daily, then wipes the row with the shipped
# `analytics wipe --id` path. It runs AFTER the feedback checks and their cleanup, so the row a
# human would otherwise have to triage is always tidied first.
#
# WHAT RUNS WHERE:
#   HOST (this file)  nonce + synthesized log -> mapped folder; VM lifecycle; then the cloud
#                     half via `node --import tsx scripts/smoke-feedback.mts verify` and
#                     `... verify-telemetry`, which read the LIVE cluster through
#                     src/main/triage/store.ts (AWS profile 'eqc' by default) and clean up
#                     after a pass.
#   GUEST (in the VM) scripts\sandbox\smoke-feedback.ps1 - plant the log, download + checksum
#                     the installer, install /S, launch it with EQ_SMOKE_FEEDBACK=<nonce>,
#                     relay the app's one stdout line back as OUTCOME:, then relaunch it
#                     plainly for the telemetry leg and relay ANALYTICSID:.
#
# THE VERDICTS:
#   PASS            the report and its scrubbed slice were found in the cloud and deleted, AND
#                   the install's analytics row + a session counter were found and the row
#                   deleted.
#   CLOSED          the feedback server answered `closed` - the operator's kill switch is ON.
#                   The client-side plumbing is PROVEN (we reached the API and got a deliberate
#                   refusal); there is no row to verify. NOT a failure; exits 0.
#   LIT-BUT-CLOSED  the same thing for telemetry: `telemetry_accepting` is off, so every batch
#                   was refused by design and no row exists to check. NOT a failure; exits 0.
#   FAIL            anything else. On a failure NOTHING that failed is cleaned up - the row, the
#                   object, the guest's captured stdout and the VM's verdict file are evidence.
#
# The sandbox lifecycle (single-instance guard, off-primary parking, results polling, force
# teardown) is NOT reimplemented here: it is shared with the tier-2 installer harness in
# sandbox-lifecycle.ps1.
#
# ASCII only (see smoke-feedback.ps1 for why).
