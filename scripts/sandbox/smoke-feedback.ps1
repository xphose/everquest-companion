# smoke-feedback.ps1 - runs INSIDE Windows Sandbox (invoked by smoke-feedback.wsb's
# LogonCommand). The GUEST half of the post-release end-to-end feedback smoke test.
#
# ON-DEMAND ONLY, after a release. Do not launch this .wsb directly and do not wire it into
# CI: it downloads the PUBLISHED installer and files a REAL bug report against the LIVE
# ingest API. Run it through the host wrapper:
#   npm run smoke:release      (scripts\sandbox\run-smoke-feedback.ps1)
# which generates the nonce, writes the mocked log, drives this VM, and then verifies + cleans
# up the row and the slice in the cloud.
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES that the tier-2 installer test cannot: that a machine which has only ever
# seen the PUBLISHED artifact can carry a user's bug report all the way to the operator's
# backlog - through the shipped validator, the live quota, the live kill switch, the presign,
# and the bucket pin - and that the log slice which arrives has been SCRUBBED. The host proves
# the far end; this script proves the near end and hands over one machine-readable outcome.
#
# AND, SINCE THE TELEMETRY CLIENT WAS LIT, a second leg: the same installed build, launched
# plainly and left running, must send its anonymous usage counts to the live ingest route. The
# guest hands the host the app's own analyticsId; the host looks for it in analytics_install,
# checks the counters moved, and then deletes that row. See step 7.
#
# THE HANDSHAKE with the host, over the one read-write mapped folder (C:\results):
#   host -> guest   smoke-nonce.txt   the run's nonce, one line
#                   smoke-log.txt     the synthesized EverQuest log (scripts/smokeLog.mts)
#   guest -> host   smoke-result.txt  the verdict, incl. OUTCOME:, REPORTID: and ANALYTICSID:
#                   smoke-stdout.txt  the app's captured stdout (kept for diagnosis)
#
# ASCII ONLY. The sandbox runs Windows PowerShell 5.1, which reads a BOM-less .ps1 as ANSI; a
# stray non-ASCII character inside a string is a parse error there and the whole harness dies
# before it can test anything.
#
# HARNESS RULES (inherited from installer-test.ps1, and they still apply):
#  * smoke-result.txt is written from a finally block - a harness that dies silently looks
#    exactly like a hung VM from the host side. Always leave a verdict behind.
#  * Teardown is the HOST launcher's job. Shutting the guest down from in here pops a modal on
#    the host desktop.

  # 7. THE TELEMETRY LEG. The feedback half above proves one deliberate Send; this proves the
  #    other thing a released build does on its own - anonymous usage counts, on a 60 s timer.
  #
  #    WHY A SECOND LAUNCH: the smoke hook quits the app the moment the submit resolves, which
  #    is seconds. A flush tick is 60 s. So the app is started again, PLAINLY - no env var, no
  #    hook, nothing armed - and simply left running the way a player leaves it running.
  #
  #    WHY THE SETTINGS PATCH: nothing may be transmitted before the first-run notice has been
  #    seen, and `noticeShown` is set by exactly one thing - a click on that bar. There is no
  #    human in this VM to click it. So the guest answers it the way a user would, in the file
  #    the user's click would have written, BETWEEN the two launches. This does not bypass the
  #    consent gate, it SATISFIES it: the gate itself (and the fact that the app is silent until
  #    it is satisfied) is proven by tests/telemetryNet.test.mts and tests/e2e/telemetry.e2e.mts,
  #    which is where a gate belongs - here we are testing the wire.
  #
  #    NON-FATAL BY DESIGN: these checks do not touch $pass. A telemetry problem must not make
  #    the host skip the feedback cloud verification (which would also skip its cleanup and
  #    leave a real report row behind). The host reads ANALYTICSID: and renders this leg's
