// gen-data-weight.mts — writes the committed data-weight ledger. `npm run gen:data-weight`.
//
// WHY IT IS GENERATED AND NOT MEASURED ON A LAUNCH: stated in full at the top of
// `src/shared/dataWeight.ts`. The short form is that every corpus is an ES import inlined into the
// bundle, so there is no file at runtime, and re-parsing 11 MB to price it would cost ~250 ms of
// blocked main — the exact defect JOS-458's G2 forbids.
//
// WHAT MAKES IT HONEST is `tests/dataWeight.test.mts`, which re-walks the tree and fails when a
// listed file's real size disagrees with the ledger, or when a corpus over the floor is missing
// from it. So a data change that skips this script turns the suite red rather than shipping a
// ledger that lies. Same contract `gen-telemetry-doc.mts` has with `tests/telemetryDoc.test.mts`.
//
// RUN IT WITH `--expose-gc`. Without it the retained-heap column is noise: the measurement is a
// `heapUsed` delta across a parse, and an un-forced collection between the two reads makes the
// number meaningless. The script refuses rather than reporting a figure it cannot stand behind.
//
// IT PARSES; IT DOES NOT SCRAPE. Nothing here touches a wiki, a network or a game log — it reads
// files already committed to this repo and reports their size and what parsing them costs.
