/**
 * gen-engine-spell-overlay.mts — project the TWO TypeScript overlay LISTS into the sidecar the Rust
 * parser reads (JOS-469).
 *
 * `engine/crates/eqlog` loads the SAME committed `spells.json` and `messageOverlay.baseline.json`
 * the app does, by `include_str!`, so those two have exactly one copy each. `SPELL_REMOVALS` and
 * `SPELL_CORRECTIONS` are not JSON — they are TypeScript arrays with prose attached — and nothing
 * on the Rust side can import them. This writes the fields the PARSER's output depends on into
 * `engine/crates/eqlog/data/spell-overlay.json`.
 *
 * WHAT IS PROJECTED, and what is deliberately dropped: `attribution` and `evidence` are the
 * argument for a correction, not an input to it, and `verified`/`reason`/`supersededBy` are the
 * argument for a removal. The load path reads `spells` / `field` / `from` / `to`, and `spell`. A
 * `classes` correction is carried anyway even though no classifier reads that field, because
 * `rowsFor` treats it like `name`/`spellType` and dropping it would make the two sides' row
 * accounting differ for a reason that is invisible until it isn't.
 *
 * AN `effects` CORRECTION IS NOT PROJECTED, and the omission is a closed list rather than a habit:
 * the sidecar's charter is the fields the PARSER's output depends on, the parser's `SpellEntry`
 * does not carry the slot list, and its `field_of` deliberately PANICS on a field it does not
 * know — the safety this filter exists to preserve. A future field the parser should carry gets
 * added to `PARSER_FIELDS` and to the Rust reader in the same change, never by loosening either.
 *
 * DRIFT IS CAUGHT TWICE. `npm run oracle:rust-parser` regenerates this file and refuses to compare
 * when the committed copy is stale; and a list that moved without the sidecar moves the TS goldens,
 * so byte-identity fails on the next check either way.
 *
 * The output is LF-normalized and ends with a newline, on JOS-458's ruling: a line ending is not a
 * data change and must not make two checkouts disagree about a committed artifact.
