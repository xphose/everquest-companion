// knowledge.ts — the slice of the main app's bridge that asks main WHAT SOMETHING IS: a spell, an
// item, a mob. The renderer-side twin of src/main/ipc/knowledge.ts, method for method.
//
// A separate file for FILE MASS, not for scope: src/preload/index.ts sits at the measured
// 400-code-line ceiling and the rule here is to SPLIT rather than ratchet (roster.ts, windows.ts,
// sounds.ts and perf.ts are the same pattern). This object is spread into that bridge, so every
// method below is an ordinary member of the one `window.eq` surface and no call site moved.
//
// Individual lookups degrade unknown spells and failed item/mob fetches to honest records.
// The whole-catalog bootstrap is stricter: a failed read rejects so startup can offer Retry
// instead of silently mixing bundled reference rows with another active snapshot.
