// planner.ts — the slice of the main app's bridge that is about PLANNING GEAR: the exaltation
// planner (docs/plans/exaltation-planner.md §4.1, §6) and the Gear tab (JOS-283/JOS-285).
//
// A separate file for FILE MASS, not for scope — the roster.ts/windows.ts/perf.ts pattern, and the
// rule those files state: `src/preload/index.ts` sits at the measured 400-code-line ceiling and the
// answer is to SPLIT rather than to ratchet. Phase 4 needed one more method than that file had room
// for. This object is spread into the bridge, so every method below is an ordinary member of the
// one `window.eq` surface and no renderer call site changes.
//
// AND THE SPLIT PAYS A DEBT WHILE IT IS HERE: `gearIndex`'s payload type used to be spelled as an
// inline `import(...)` expression precisely because an import line was a code line index.ts could
// not spare. There is room here, so both gear payloads are imported like everything else.
//
// EVERY METHOD IS A READ OVER COMMITTED BYTES OR A FILE ON DISK, except the one write. Nothing
// here rejects: the corpus is compiled into the main bundle, and a missing `/outputfile inventory`
// dump is a `null`/empty answer that the surfaces render as their instructions card.
