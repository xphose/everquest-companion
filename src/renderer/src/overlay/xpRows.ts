// xpRows.ts — the PURE shaping behind the XP overlay (JOS-195): a progression snapshot, this
// character's loot, and one slice, turned into the exact strings that window prints.
//
// No React, no MUI, no `window.eqOverlay`. VALUE imports are RELATIVE, never `@shared/*` — that
// alias exists only inside the vite build and the node runner would not resolve it — so
// tests/xpOverlay.test.mts drives every rule here under plain tsx. Same constraint
// aaPaceRows.ts / rangeStatsRows.ts / overviewLevelingData.ts already document.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// IT DERIVES NOTHING OF ITS OWN. Every number below already exists somewhere:
//
//   the pace      `rangeStats` (shared/progressionStats.ts) — the drag-select panel's own query
//   the slice     `resolveSlice` (shared/timeslice.ts) — the Leveling tab's own control, JOS-130
//   the level ETA `levelEta` (shared/levelEta.ts) — the Overview card's own four gates
//   the AA read   `aaEta` (shared/aaPace.ts) — JOS-36/11, the read that survives the cap
//   the motes     `moteRates` → `windowItemRows` (shared/lootRates.ts) — JOS-78's own rate
//
// So a number in this window and the same number on the Leveling tab cannot disagree: there is
// one arithmetic and this file only chooses the words. That is the whole point of the ticket's
// "fed from the same selectors the Leveling tab uses".
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// AA IS A SECOND PACE, NOT A CONSOLATION PRIZE FOR THE CAP (JOS-202).
//
// The first cut swapped the pace row's SUBJECT at the cap: levels while the bar was stated, AA once
// it was not. That is the wrong shape, because the two are not alternatives — a character in their
// forties is filling a level bar and an AA bar at the same time, and the owner wants both read at a
// glance. So the pace checklist entry draws ONE ROW PER MEASURE THE LOG STATES, exactly as the
// motes entry draws one row per tier observed:
//
//   'xp'  levels of progress per hour — while the game is still stating a level-bar percentage.
//   'aa'  AA completions per hour, with the ability points they paid riding as the row's detail.
//
// WHEN EACH ONE IS THERE, and why:
//   · the levels row goes away AT THE CAP (`atCap`) and only there — every levels number is built
//     on stated percentages, and at max level the game stops stating them. A permanent em-dash is
//     a row a capped character closes the window over.
//   · the AA row is drawn ALWAYS (owner ruling, 2026-08-10). AAs are earned below the cap in this
//     game, so "no completion in this slice" is not "AA does not apply to you" — it is a measured
//     0.00, exactly the reading the cap case has always printed, and exactly what the levels row
//     does below the cap when an hour of farming moved no bar. Gating it on a completion made the
//     row appear and disappear under a user who is watching a rate, which is the one thing a rate
//     display must not do. (The Leveling tab's `aaRateText` still says nothing about AA in a
//     silent window; that is a page with other things on it, this is a four-row meter whose
//     subject is pace.)
//
// The two rates are the same denominator (active time, stated once under the rows), so they read
// against each other, and the AA pair (completions · points) is printed together for the reason the
// Leveling tab prints it together: they are equal until an item-shop bottle is running and diverge
// while one is, and that divergence is the whole reading.
//
// The PROJECTION row still switches: 'Next level' while there is a bar to finish, 'Next AA' once
// there is not. It is one row and one question ("what lands next"), and at the cap the level half
// of it has no answer at all.
//
// THE AA WAIT IS INFERRED AND WEARS THE WORD (`AA_EST`). The log carries no AA-experience line
// anywhere — there is no bar position to sum — so it is projected from the rhythm of recent
// completions. The level ETA is a different kind of claim (a sum of stated percentages divided by
// a measured pace) and does not wear it; both are still `~`.
