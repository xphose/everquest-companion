// XpOverlay (JOS-195) — the PROGRESS read, floating over the game: how fast the bar is moving,
// when it lands, and motes per hour by type.
//
// Two reports converged on it from opposite ends — "xp/hr + eta overlay" and "a session widget:
// dps, motes gathered, xp, money, configurable" — and the owner's scope is the narrow half of
// that: the numbers a leveller glances at, NUMBERS FIRST AND SMALL, with a ROW CHECKLIST and no
// widget builder. So there are three checklist entries, they can each be switched off, and that is
// the whole of the configurability. An ENTRY IS NOT A LINE COUNT: 'motes' draws one line per tier
// seen, and since JOS-202 'xp' draws one line per pace the log is stating — levels per hour and AA
// per hour, because both bars fill while you level (shared/xpOverlay.ts states the rule).
//
// IT DERIVES NOTHING. Every number is the Leveling tab's own — `rangeStats`, `levelEta`, `aaEta`,
// `windowItemRows` — composed by `overlay/xpRows.ts`, which is pure and node-tested. This file
// draws the result and owns the window: the persisted config, the drag/resize, the slice picker in
// the header, the checklist in the footer. A second rate math in a floating window would be the
// drift `windowScope.ts` exists to prevent, one process further away.
//
// THE SLICE IS THE LEVELING TAB'S (JOS-130) AND ITS DEFAULT IS `Zone + Session` (owner ruling,
// JOS-288 — it was `session` from JOS-195 until then). A window you glance at mid-pull is asking
// "how am I doing right now", and the audit measured what the session half alone does to that
// answer: `levelEquiv` sums straight across a loadout-swap boundary, so a session that began on a
// level-50 leg diluted the level-11 camp that followed it, and the same instant read 7.03 lvl/hr
// scoped to the camp against a figure ten times smaller scoped to the whole log. The camp you are
// standing in, this session, is the stretch the number is about. It DEGRADES rather than sticks — a
// preset this record cannot define is not offered and `resolveSliceId` falls back to `All`, exactly
// as the tab's own control does. The pick is remembered per WINDOW, not shared with the app's: the
// two are read at different moments, and a slice chosen on the Loot tab has no business re-scoping
// a window floating over the game.
//
// AND THE RATES ARE PER ELAPSED HOUR BY DEFAULT (owner ruling 3, JOS-288), with the active reading
// one click away in the footer. Both words are the loot ledger's (JOS-261) and both definitions are
// imported rather than re-worded. The bonus is an honesty the window did not have: the next-level
// ETA has ALWAYS divided by the wall rate while the pace row above it showed the active one, so
// until now those two lines were measured over different hours.
//
// THE TIER AND THE HOUR ARE NOT THIS WINDOW'S TO REMEMBER ANY MORE (JOS-332). They used to be two
// more persisted per-kind knobs beside the row checklist, on the argument that an overlay remembers
// everything about itself — and the owner's bug report is what that argument cost: he had *this
// tier* on screen over the game and read `elapsed 27m` off the Leveling tab, which is the every-tier
// number, because the two windows kept two states behind one label. So both knobs now read and
// write the ONE app-wide selection main holds (`shared/scopeSelection.ts`), the footer buttons flip
// it for every window at once, and the tab's toggle row flips it for this one. The SLICE is
// untouched and still remembered here: which stretch a floating window measures is genuinely its
// own business (`shared/types.ts xpSlice` states why), and it is not a knob the tab also shows.
//
// IT TICKS ITSELF, for the same reason the timer bars do: deltas arrive when the LOG moves, and a
// slice that ends at the live edge keeps meaning something while the log is silent. The clock is
// SLOW here (30 s, not 1 s) because nothing in this window is a countdown — a rate over an hour
// does not visibly move in a second, and the cost of asking is a whole `rangeStats` fold.
//
// MUI-FREE, plain divs and inline styles, like every file in this bundle.
