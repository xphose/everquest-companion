// BuffsOverlay (JOS-89; split into TWO WINDOWS by JOS-119) — the timer-bar surface, rendered once
// per timer kind: 'buffs' draws live effects on you plus logged target buffs; 'debuffs' draws what you
// have put on something else (debuffs plus the per-enemy crowd-control clocks, so a chain-mez
// shows a named countdown per enemy). Design record: docs/plans/buff-timer-overlay.md.
//
// Ten user reports converge on this window; the owner then asked for the two halves to be windows
// he could enable and place separately, because "what is on me" and "what is on them" are read at
// different moments and belong in different corners of the screen. Both ship DEFAULT OFF (store.ts
// DEFAULT_OVERLAY_CONFIG, no migration) — JOS-89's internal-validation stance, continued.
//
// ONE COMPONENT, TWO KINDS — the JOS-105 no-fork rule, and a copy of this file would be a defect.
// Their timer differences are DATA (`SURFACE` below): the chrome label, the
// accent, the empty-state sentence, the heading a self row sits under, and which rows the surface
// keeps. Everything else — the modules, the projection, the clock, the chrome, the footer — is
// the same code running twice. Only buffs reads the current native self-effect list.
//
// A sibling of OverlayMeter and EventLogOverlay in the SAME overlay.html bundle (kind read from
// `?kind=`), so it shares every piece of per-kind machinery: the persisted `overlays.<kind>`
// config, drag/resize, the bg-alpha slider, the text-scale stepper and the lock (pin) semantics.
// Plain divs + inline styles, no MUI — the window has to be cheap to paint over the game.
//
// DATA: TWO modules, composed by ONE pure function, FOLDED ONCE — and then filtered. `buffs` owns
// the instances (self buffs, per-target debuffs, the DB duration prior, own-cast gating, the
// death/zone censoring); the small `buffTimers` module owns the per-target mez holds the buff
// model does not track. Neither is re-folded here and NEITHER IS FORKED FOR THE SECOND WINDOW —
// `shared/buffTimers.ts buildTimerRows` is the projection, `rowsForSurface` is the one-line split,
// both are pure, and tests/buffTimers.test.mts drives them over real fixture bytes. This file only
// draws the result. Two windows, one model: a second fold of the same events is the two-models
// scar world-model law 4 is made of.
//
// Live native self effects supersede logged self rows only while the complete observation is fresh.
// Their countdown is approximate, with no invented initial duration or permanent classification.
// THE HONESTY LAW FOR LOGGED TIMERS: a receding bar means spells.json STATED a duration. A row with no
// bar and a `+` before its time is counting UP because nobody states one. The overlay never
// renders a remaining it had to invent — see buffTimerBars.tsx.
//
// WHY IT TICKS ITSELF: the module cursors arrive when the LOG moves, and a buff running out is
// precisely the moment the log is silent. A 1 Hz local clock re-reads rows the renderer already
// holds; it asks main for nothing.
