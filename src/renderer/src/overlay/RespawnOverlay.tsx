// RespawnOverlay (JOS-194) — the respawn clocks, floating over the game.
//
// This window is the whole point of the ticket in practice. A respawn timer you have to alt-tab to
// read is a timer you do not read; the corroborating report (01KZQ4X16MPDKQ2CF4SY35P5ED) is from
// somebody who left a tool that put named-mob clocks on screen and missed them. So the Timers tab
// is where you SET this up and this window is where you USE it.
//
// IT DERIVES NOTHING AND FOLDS NOTHING. Every row is the `respawn` module's own, composed by the
// same pure helpers the tab reads (`orderRespawnRows`, `respawnReading`, `respawnSourceLabel`) —
// a second opinion about which mob is due soonest, one process away from the first, is exactly the
// drift the shared/ split exists to prevent.
//
// IT SHOWS THE ZONE YOU ARE IN, AND NOTHING ELSE (owner ruling after the first hands-on round,
// 2026-08-10). The fold keeps every zone it has walked through, and this window used to draw all of
// them — so a Befallen camp put four Guk clocks over the game, none of which anybody could act on.
// The filter is `respawnInZone(snap.rows, snap.zone)`: the module's OWN zone-stay state, published
// in the snapshot, applied by the shared helper the Timers tab also calls. Nothing is derived here
// and no second zone is tracked. A clock in another zone is not hidden data — it is still in the
// fold and still on the tab's all-zones view — it is just not something this window can help with,
// and that includes one that has come DUE (see the helper's header).
//
// IT TICKS ITSELF, at 1 Hz, because a countdown is the one thing in this app that must keep moving
// while the log is silent — and a row carries its own `baseTs`, so ticking costs no IPC at all.
// (The XP window's clock is 30 s for the opposite reason: nothing in it is a countdown.)
//
// AND IT IS WHERE THE ROUND-3 RULING HAS TO LAND (owner, 2026-08-10). The defect was reported from
// live play: the mob was hitting him and the row over the game still read "due 4m ago". So a row
// the log has NAMED since its clock started reads UP here, in its own colour, sorted to the top —
// and the affordance that re-bases the clock onto that sighting lives here too, in INTERACTIVE
// mode, because a locked window is click-through by law and has no clicks to give. Confirming from
// the Timers tab is the same call on the same module (`confirmRespawnSighting`); this window simply
// spares you the alt-tab in the one moment the feature is for.
//
// AND ROUND 4 LANDS HERE FOR THE SAME REASON (owner, 2026-08-10). Unwatching used to mean finding
// the name in the watch list at the bottom of the Timers tab — i.e. alt-tabbing out of the game to
// get rid of a row that is wrong about the mob in front of you, which on EQ's duplicated names is
// the common case. So a row here carries its own Unwatch, in INTERACTIVE mode only, beside the
// confirm affordance and under the same law: a locked window is click-through and has no clicks to
// give. It stops that NAME everywhere, including zones this window does not show — which the
// button's title used to say, until the owner deleted every Unwatch tooltip in the round-7 addendum
// on the grounds that the control speaks for itself. The behaviour is unchanged and argued in
// shared/respawn.ts; nothing on screen recites it.
//
// AND ROUND 6'S HOVER CARD IS GONE AGAIN (owner, 2026-08-10, round 7 — and the reversal is the
// interesting part). Round 6 put the mob's drop card on these rows as well as on the tab's; the
// owner used it and ruled it out HERE only: it "takes the overlay over too completely". The
// arithmetic is plain once you have seen it — this window is about 300px wide and its rows are 30px
// tall, and the card is 300px wide and can run several times a row's height, so pointing anywhere
// replaces the countdown you opened the window for with a drop table. The card is not worse than it
// was; it is bigger than its host. So it is IN-APP ONLY.
//
// …AND JOS-358 FINISHED THE JOB: the plain `title` round 5 left on the row is gone too. The owner
// ruled from hands-on testing that these windows keep tooltips ONLY in the title bar, and a row
// hover was also leaving popups stranded over the game when the cursor flicked out. So a row states
// its clock, its colour and its bar, and nothing else; `respawnProvenance` is unchanged and is what
// the Timers tab's own card leads with (features/timers, lib/hoverCards.tsx). The header count's
// hover — `RESPAWN_LEGEND_TITLE`, the two claims this window makes — is in the TITLE BAR and stays.
//
// (Nothing about round 6's REFACTOR is undone: the card still lives in `lib/hoverCards.tsx`, where
// the event overlay's `/con` rows and the Timers tab both draw it. One of its two new callers went
// away, not the move.)
//
// AND ROUND 8 PUTS ROWS HERE THAT NO CLOCK IS RUNNING FOR (owner, 2026-08-11). A watched mob always
// has a row now — the fold no longer retires one whose estimate elapsed half an hour ago — so this
// window can hold a clock that ran out overnight beside one with four minutes left. Over the game
// that ordering is the whole product, so the two are told apart without reading: the long-gone row
// is GREY, says "due long ago" (or "awaiting next death") instead of a number that grows forever,
// draws no bar, and `orderRespawnRows` sinks it under every live clock. It keeps its Unwatch,
// because it is still a mob you asked for.
//
// AND ROUND 9 PUTS A STATE HERE AND NONE OF ITS CONTROLS (owner, 2026-08-11). A row whose duration
// the player set themselves is OVERRIDDEN, and over the game that is worth knowing at a glance — so
// the rung line goes violet, a colour this window uses for nothing else, off the same
// `respawnOverridden` the tab paints in gold. What does NOT come here is the editing: the edit icon
// and its modal are tab-only, for exactly the reason round 7 removed the hover card from this window
// (a 300px window cannot host a 300px surface) and because a locked window is click-through and has
// no clicks to give. Its rung line also stopped spelling the duration inline and reads
// `respawnDurationText`, so the `<=` that says "upper bound" cannot go missing on one surface.
//
// MUI-FREE, plain divs and inline styles, like every file in this bundle.
