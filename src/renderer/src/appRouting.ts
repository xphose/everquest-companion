// appRouting — the app's DEEP-LINK routers, lifted out of App.tsx (2026-08-04).
//
// They lived beside the component until the loot link pushed that file over the measured
// 400-code-line ceiling, and this is the seam the ceiling was pointing at: App.tsx is a
// COMPOSITION (title bar, nav, content, toasts, dialogs), while these two hooks are the app's
// navigation MODEL — pure state and openers, no JSX, no MUI. Splitting them changed no
// behaviour: every rule below is the one that was written next to the component, verbatim.

 *
 * `origin === null` is the NATIVE arrival: the receiver's Back keeps doing exactly what it always
 * did (drill → its own list). That is why `back()` returns a boolean rather than navigating

 * subscription. If `linkTo` changed identity on every tab switch, that cross-window subscription
 * would be torn down and re-registered every time the user clicked a nav row. The ref is written
 * in an effect (after paint) and read in click handlers (later still), so it is never stale where
 * it is read.
 *
 * THE RETURN IS MEMOIZED (JOS-510 item 3), and so is the `nav` object inside it. Every MEMBER was
 * already a `useCallback`, which made the individual openers stable and the CONTAINERS new objects
 * on every render — so `routing` and `routing.nav` defeated any `React.memo` placed downstream
 * before it could compare anything. `origin` is `originTop(origins)`, an ELEMENT of the state array
 * rather than a derived object, so it only moves when the stack does.

 *
 * `open` takes an OPTIONAL payload so one signature serves both idioms: the three destinations that
 * are real places on their own (`openLoot()`, `openQuest()`, `openLeveling()` bare) and the three
 * that are nothing without their subject (`openMob`, `openCombat`, `openSpell`, whose declared
 * parameter is required and so can never reach the bare branch). `anchored` then falls out of the
