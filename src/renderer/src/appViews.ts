  // It was a top-level nav row of its own until JOS-324; it is now the FIRST TAB of the gear area
  // (see `GEAR_AREA_VIEWS` below) and its view id, route and every `gear-*` testid are unchanged.
  | 'gear'
  // The WISH LIST (JOS-324 shell, JOS-326 content) — the third face of the gear area: the items
  // you have decided you want, kept as a list rather than derived from a plan. It ships this
  // ticket as an honest placeholder panel and gains its content in JOS-326.

  // OWNER-ONLY view (src/renderer/src/features/triage/**). It stays in the union
  // unconditionally because a union member is a TYPE and types are erased — nothing of it
  // survives compilation. What actually strips is the CODE: the nav row, the content branch
  // and the whole component tree sit behind `OWNER_TOOLS` (DEV **and** `EQ_OWNER_TOOLS=1`,
  // JOS-72), and `KNOWN_VIEWS` below drops the string itself in a build or a checkout without
  // it, so a persisted 'triage' can never leave anyone staring at an empty content area.
  | 'triage'
  // The CHARACTER SHEET (src/renderer/src/features/character/**) — the gear area's LAST TAB: what
  // you are wearing right now, read out of the newest `/outputfile inventory` dump, plus the
  // searchable ledger of everything else that dump lists. It was UNRELEASED from JOS-45 (a
  // compile-time strip behind `UNRELEASED`, absent from every packaged build) until the owner
  // released it in JOS-327; it is an ordinary member of both lists below now.
  | 'character'
  // THE SPELL DRILLDOWN (JOS-508) — the first member of this union that is NOT a tab.
  //
  // It has no nav row (components/NavDrawer.tsx `ROWS` is an explicit list and this is not in it)
  // and it is deliberately ABSENT from `KNOWN_VIEWS` below, which is the one thing making that
  // work: a view id the build cannot restore bounces to the default on launch, and a spell page
  // with no spell is exactly the thing nobody should be able to come back to. It is reached ONLY
  // by clicking a spell name — every one of them, through `lib/spellLink.tsx` — and left by Back.
  //
  // AND IT IS ABSENT FROM `TELEMETRY_VIEWS` (shared/telemetry.ts) ON PURPOSE. That enum is
  // validated by the ingest Lambda, so a new member is a SERVER DEPLOY before it is a client
  // change; `lib/telemetry.ts dwellView` already fails closed for a view the schema does not
  // carry — its header calls that "the ONE deliberate exception" — so this page reports no dwell
  // and distorts no other tab's, with no deploy ordering to arrange. The same applies to
  // `noteCurrentView` in main, which drops an unknown id and keeps the last one it trusted: an
  // error thrown here is attributed to the tab you came from, which for a drill is the honest
  // answer anyway. Widening either enum is a separate, owner-sequenced change.

// ============================================================================
// THE GEAR AREA — one nav row, four tabs (JOS-324)
// ============================================================================
//
// THE LAW THIS REPLACES. Until JOS-324 the nav drawer's law was one row per view, full stop, and
// three of those rows were three faces of the SAME question — Gear (what should I be wearing),
// Exaltations (what am I farming for) and the dev-only Character sheet (what am I wearing right
// now). Three rows put three answers to one question in a vertical list where nothing said they
// belonged together, and the third of them hung off the bottom behind a flag. The owner's ruling
// (2026-08-13, the One Coin Four Faces design) collapses them into ONE nav row with an in-area tab
// bar — and adds the fourth face the list had no room to grow: a Wish list (what do I want).
//
// WHAT DID **NOT** CHANGE, and that is the whole point of this shape. The view ids are untouched
// (`gear`, `planner`, `character`, plus the new `wishlist`), App still renders exactly ONE view at
// a time, and every tab switch travels the ordinary `selectView` path a nav row travels. So deep
// links still land, `viewKey` still unmounts the outgoing view on a switch, and the Back stack
// (appRouting.ts / navOrigin.ts / backTargets.ts) keeps its semantics to the letter — a tab click
// is MANUAL navigation and clears the parked trail, which is what a nav-row click always did.
//
// THE ORDER IS THE TAB BAR'S ORDER, and Character is LAST on purpose: it is the only member that
// is not a shopping question. (It was also the one the review gate could still take away — JOS-327
// released it, and the order is unchanged because the first reason was always the real one.)
