// lib/itemSources.ts — "where does this item come from?", answered locally from the committed
// mob catalog, for EVERY surface that asks.
//
// It began life as the planner's own `features/planner/sourceIndex.ts` and was promoted here the
// moment a SECOND consumer appeared (the Loot tab's item drill-down, 2026-08-04). The reason is
// not tidiness: the index is a ~33k-link inversion of `data/eqlegends/mobs.json`, and two feature
// modules each building their own would pay for it twice and answer the same question from two
// tables. There is ONE lazy singleton, in lib/, and both features read it.
//
// The planner keeps `features/planner/sourceIndex.ts` as a re-export so its own vocabulary
// (`PlannerSource`) and its node test's import path both still resolve to this file.
//
// WHY THIS DATA IS ALREADY HERE. `data/eqlegends/mobs.json` is bundled into the renderer for the
// Mobs tab (mobSearch.ts), and every mob page states its `|known_loot`. Inverting that list gives
// an item → mobs index for free — no IPC, no network, works offline.
//
// LAZY, NEVER AT MODULE LOAD — the mobSearch precedent. Neither the Planner nor an item
// drill-down may ever be opened this session, and the catalog is immutable, so the index is built
// on first use and lives for the window's lifetime. MEASURED over the committed catalog
// (2026-08-04, node, warm): 7,872 pages, 4,410 of them with a loot list, 32,822 item→mob links
// folding onto 5,357 distinct item keys.
//
// THE KEY IS THE ITEM'S CANONICAL KEY. Main serves `PlannerDonor.key = itemKey(name)`
// (src/main/itemsDb.ts) — `+N` stripped, case folded — and a join that used any other spelling
// would silently find nothing for the ~1,900 catalog drop names that carry an upgrade suffix.
// The renderer cannot import main, so the rule is re-applied here from its SHARED half
// (`itemBaseName`), which is the same function main's `itemKey` calls. A caller holding a display
// NAME (the loot drill-down holds the name off a loot line) goes through `sourceItemKey`.
//
// It says only what the catalog says (law 1): a mob, its page, the level text VERBATIM (a range
// as often as a number) and its zones. No rarity — the compact catalog carries item names only —
// and no invented drop rate.

import type { ItemDropSource, MobEntry, MobLoc } from '@shared/types'
// RELATIVE value import (house law, the mobSearch.ts precedent): the `@shared` alias exists only
// inside the vite build, and `tests/plannerSourceIndex.test.mts` reaches this module under the
// node runner. Type-only imports are erased, so they keep the alias.
