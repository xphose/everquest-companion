// lineIntel — the renderer's join for spell-LINE intelligence.
//
// Three inputs, all of which the app already carries:
//   * the spell CATALOG (spells:catalog) — per line: the DB's rank names + per-class levels,
//   * the ALERTS module snapshot's `spellLastCast` — rank-preserving cast recency, kept live
//     by module deltas (a cast pushes a delta, so nothing here polls),
//   * the CURRENT class selection — fresh matching game facts with the resolved log combo as
//     fallback, so a level chip can say "yours" instead of "one of these".
//
// Everything computational lives in shared/spellLines.ts (pure, tested); this is wiring plus
// the one piece of local state the feature owns — per-offer dismissals, kept in localStorage
// beside `eq.combat.scope` rather than in the electron-store schema, because a dismissed
// suggestion is a UI preference and adding a persisted shape would demand a store migration.
