// gear/gearOwnership.ts — THE JOIN (JOS-285, phase 4): do I own this, where is it, at what +N.
//
// This is the phase the feature exists for. A wiki tab can tell you a Cloak of Flames has AC 10;
// only this app can tell you there is one on your back at +2 and another in your bank at base.
// Phase 3 left the seam and named it: `row.key` is `itemKey(name)`, which IS `ownershipKey`, which
// IS the loot history's `itemCountKey` (ownership.ts pins all three together). So the join is a
// map lookup and nothing else — no name matching, no normalising, no second opinion about what a
// ` +N` suffix is.
//
// PURE AND NODE-TESTED (`tests/gearOwnership.test.mts`), the `gearFilter.ts` precedent: relative
// value imports, no React, no IPC. Every WORD this feature puts on screen about ownership is
// decided here, so the wording can be pinned without a DOM — and the wording is most of the work.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// FOUR HONESTY RULES, EACH OF THEM A DECISION THIS FILE MAKES ON PURPOSE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// 1. `+N` IS A FACT, NOT A SUMMARY. Phase 1's design decision — a `+2` in the bank and a base copy
//    equipped are two ROWS under one key — survives all the way to the cell. `ownedFacts` groups
//    by (place, +N) and NEVER folds two plus-states into "you have 2". `Equipped · Bank +2` is
//    what the dump said; "2 owned" is a different, worse sentence that no reader can undo. A place
//    at base tier renders as the bare place name, preserving the ordinary export's uncluttered
//    spelling. An unknown tier also stays undecorated; it never acquires an invented suffix.
//
// 2. AN `(Exaltation)` ROW IS NOT A COPY. The client files a socketed exaltation under the NAME OF
//    THE ITEM IT CAME FROM: `Feet-Slot7  Golden Efreeti Boots (Exaltation)` is a gem socketed into
//    whatever is on your feet, not a pair of boots. Counting those rows as ownership would tell a
//    player they own an item they consumed to make the gem — the owner's own dump has four of
//    them, one of which (Golden Efreeti Boots) he owns in NO other form. So exaltation rows are
//    counted separately and reported as what they are. `heldCountsFromDump` counts them because
//    its question is "how many rows name this"; this file's question is "can you wear one".
//
// 3. "NOT COUNTED" IS NOT "NOT OWNED". The fold inherits `HELD_KEYRING_CATEGORIES`, so an item
//    sitting only on an `Activated` key ring reads as not-owned here — and the exclusion is stated
//    where the join RENDERS, over the player's own file (`uncountedNote`), rather than being left
//    in a module header the player will never see. The roster is not re-decided here and no second
//    one is written: the day `Activated` graduates in `shared/outputs/inventory.ts`, this note
//    stops appearing on its own.
//
// 4. LOOTED-BUT-NOT-IN-THE-DUMP IS ITS OWN ANSWER, AND IT DOES NOT RESTATE THE DUMP'S AGE. The log
//    is a second witness the dump cannot contradict: it says the item passed through your hands.
//    It may have been sold, traded, consumed into an exaltation — or the dump may simply predate
//    it. That last possibility is REAL and it is already answered on screen by the `/outputfile`
//    freshness line (JOS-253/268, `OutputKindLine`), which knows both instants. So the wording
//    here points AT that line and never states an age of its own; two clocks on one surface is how
//    a surface starts disagreeing with itself.
