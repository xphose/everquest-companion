// gear/gearCompare.ts — THE COMPARISON (JOS-338): this item, against what is on your body right
// now, in the slots this item would go in.
//
// WHAT THE TAB WAS MISSING. Phase 4 (JOS-285) taught the table to say whether you OWN a candidate;
// it never said what the candidate would REPLACE. "AC 20" is a fact about an item and no help at
// all until it is read beside the 32 already on your chest — and this app is the only thing that
// can put the two numbers side by side, because one of them comes from the player's own
// `/outputfile inventory` dump.
//
// PURE AND NODE-TESTED (`tests/gearCompare.test.mts`), the `gearOwnership.ts` precedent, and for
// the same two reasons: relative value imports so the node runner can drive it with no bundler,
// and every WORD this feature puts on screen decided here rather than inside a component. The card
// (`GearCompareCard.tsx`) owns where a line goes; this file owns what it says.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE THREE DECISIONS THIS FILE MAKES
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// 1. THE JOIN IS CELL-BY-CELL, NOT SLOT-BY-SLOT. An item states SLOTS (`EquipSlot`, the wiki
//    vocabulary — 'EAR'); a character has CELLS (`PlanSlotId` — 'EAR' and 'EAR2', JOS-67), and the
//    dump is the witness that says there are two of them. So an earring is compared against BOTH
//    ears and a one-hander that states PRIMARY and SECONDARY is compared against both hands. The
//    cells come from `cellsForSlot`, which is the planner's own answer to "where does a FINGER item
//    go" — never a second table here (law 12: cross-source renames are knowledge, and that one is
//    already written down in shared/planner/inventorySlots.ts).
//
//    DEDUPED, IN THE ITEM'S OWN SLOT ORDER. A corpus row may state a slot twice, and two different
//    slots can never share a cell, so one `Set` over the cells is the whole of the dedupe. The order
//    is the ITEM's (PRIMARY before SECONDARY because its page says so) rather than the board's,
//    because the card is read as a sentence about this item.
//
// 2. AN EMPTY CELL IS AN ANSWER, NOT A GAP. The client prints every equipment location it has,
//    filled or not (`Ammo  Empty` is a real line in the committed 295-line dump), and
//    `equippedHosts` drops the empty ones — so a cell with no host is the dump SAYING that place is
//    bare. The card draws it as "nothing equipped", which is the most useful thing a gear planner
//    can tell you: that upgrade costs you nothing. What it never does is draw that sentence when
//    there is NO dump — that is "we cannot see your body", a different statement, and the card
//    answers it with the command instead (law 1).
//
// 3. THE ANY-CELLS ARE NOT COMPARED, AND THAT IS A DECISION RATHER THAN AN OVERSIGHT. A character
//    has two `Any Slot` places (JOS-104) and the owner's own dump wears two CHEST items in them. A
//    cell that constrains no slot is not "the slot this item occupies", so including it would put a
//    breastplate under a hovered RING as if it were the thing being replaced. `cellsForSlot`
//    already declines to return them, so this file inherits the refusal rather than restating it.
//    The cost is honest and stated here: an any-slot item is invisible to this card.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// AND THE COMPARISON ITSELF IS LAW 1, TWICE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// An absent stat means the page STATED none, never zero (`GearStats`), so a delta against an absent
// value is not a number: `HASTE 41% vs —` is what this file writes, and the parenthesised delta
// appears only where BOTH sides stated the key. The second half is the equipped copy's ` +N`: the
// dump states the tier and nothing about the exp banked toward the next one, so the worn item is
// scaled at `{full: tier, fraction: 0}` — a FLOOR on what it reads, and `equippedState` says so in
// one place rather than at each call site.
