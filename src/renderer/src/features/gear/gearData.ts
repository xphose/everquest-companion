// gear/gearData.ts — the candidate index in the renderer: fetched once, widened, and the two
// pieces of state the Gear tab keeps beside it (the global plus-state, and the class combo).
//
// ONE FETCH PER WINDOW, the `plannerData.ts` precedent and for the same reasons: `items.json` is
// 8.6 MB and stays in MAIN, the gear index is built there once and arrives over ONE IPC call, and
// the corpus is committed data that cannot change while the app runs. The promise is cached too,
// so two mounts in the same frame share one round trip.
//
// THE PAYLOAD IS VERSIONED, AND A VERSION WE DO NOT KNOW IS REFUSED (gear.ts states the contract).
// A renderer that met a `GEAR_INDEX_VERSION` from the future would be drawing a vector whose keys
// or units mean something else — so it draws nothing and says so, which is the only honest
// failure. In practice both halves ship together; this is what makes that assumption checkable.
//
// THE SEARCH KEY IS WIDENED HERE, ONCE PER DATA CHANGE. The index's own `searchKey` is the item
// NAME (gear.ts, pinned by tests/gearIndex.test.mts) because that is the only haystack a shared
// index can commit to. A player searching this table means "Improved Healing" as often as they
// mean "Blade of Light", so the table's copy folds the effect names in — the exact widening
// `plannerData.toRow` performs for donor rows, computed once here rather than per keystroke per
// row (the standing search law).

 * deliberately ("cell assignment is `equippedHosts`' job and is not repeated here"), which is
 * exactly the half this card needs: two ears are two comparisons. `plannerInventory` already
 * answers in CELLS, already carries `itemKey` (main's definition, applied in the handler) and
 * already carries the dump's mtime for the freshness line, so it is one call and no new rule.
 *
 * AND IT WAS CALLER-LESS. `features/planner/plannerInventory.ts` has said in writing since JOS-326

 * had no reader left and wanted either a caller or a four-file retirement. This is the caller.
 *
 * COST: one IPC per mount and one per `inventory:autoReloaded`, which is one parse of a ~300-line
 * file in main (the handler declines to cache on purpose — its header says why). Nothing here is
 * per row, per keystroke or per slider tick: the two maps are memos over data that moves only when

/**
 * THE UPGRADE SIMULATION'S STATE — AND THE ONE DESIGN DECISION IN IT, NOW REVERSED BY THE OWNER.
 *
 * THE OLD LAW (JOS-284, and it stood until 2026-08-13): IT IS NOT PERSISTED. Every other planner
 * preference is remembered machine-side (`eq.planner.*`) because every other one is a way of
 * READING the corpus. This one changes what the corpus SAYS — at `+5` the table states numbers no
 * item in your bags has — so a tab that silently reopened at +5 would be lying quietly, and the lie
 * would be invisible precisely because the slider is the thing you stopped looking at. It reset to
 * base on every mount, which is the state the data is actually in.
 *
 * THE OWNER RULING OF 2026-08-13 (JOS-329) OVERRIDES THAT LAW. The report named the slider in the
 * same breath as the filters and the sort — *we're losing everything right now* — and the slider
 * was losing its position on every tab switch along with them, which is the half of the old law
 * nobody had priced: the argument above is about what a NEW SESSION should open on, and it was
 * being paid for by a control that also forgot itself when you glanced at the Loot tab.
 *
 * THE OLD ARGUMENT IS ANSWERED, NOT MERELY OUTVOTED, and it is worth writing down which premise
 * failed: **the lie was never quiet.** `UpgradeSlider` renders a permanent label saying exactly what
 * is being simulated, in the item window's own words — `Tier 2  3/4  +27.5%` — and it is on screen
 * from the first paint of every mount (`gear-upgrade-label`, which the e2e reads). A restored
 * plus-state ANNOUNCES itself. What the old law was really defending against was state you could
 * not see, and this control is the opposite of that; the two remaining ways to be at a non-base
 * plus without knowing are both closed already, because hiding the control via the JOS-297 filters
 * picker puts the corpus back at base (`GearView`'s `visible.has('upgrade')` clamp) and the value
 * is validated back to a legal state on every read.
 *
 * SO IT JOINS THE REST OF THE FORM, on the RESTART tier (`areaMemory.ts` states the split and
 * `sanitizeUpgrade` states the validation, which is `normalizeUpgradeState` and never a second
 * opinion).

/**
 * THE CLASS FILTER, AND ITS PROVENANCE (V2's rule, `plannerClasses.ts` — a trio is a FILTER and
 * never a rule).
 *
 * `detected` is the default: a fresh current-player selection takes precedence over log inference.
 * The table reads for whatever the app currently believes this
 * character is running, and a loadout switch rewrites it silently and correctly, because nobody
 * has said otherwise yet. The moment the user edits the selection it PINS (`user`), and detection
 * may never overwrite it again — it can only offer, which is what `detectedOffer` is for on the
 * exaltation board and what the toolbar's "detected: …" chip does here.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES TO THE TABLE CHANGED ON 2026-08-13 (owner ruling, JOS-302). It used to enforce
 * nothing: a row outside the filter was hidden only while a companion "Usable by these" toggle was
 * on, and a row shown despite a mismatch was CHIPPED rather than removed. The owner overruled that
 * for THIS surface — the picks now NARROW the corpus, the toggle is gone and so is the chip. The
 * provenance rule above is untouched, and so is the planner build pane's own mismatch chip, which
 * is a different surface answering a different question (`gearFilter.ts GearFilters.classes`).
 *
 * ONE CONSEQUENCE WORTH SAYING OUT LOUD, because this hook is what causes it: `detected` is the
 * default, so an untouched Gear tab opens NARROWED to the classes the app infers you are running.
 * That is the reading a gear planner wants, and it is visible in three places at once — the chips
 * in the picker, the "N of 6,814 items" count line, and `GearView.emptyText` when it goes to zero.
 *
 * AND SINCE JOS-329 THE PIN SURVIVES THE TAB SWITCH THAT USED TO ERASE IT. `pinned` was `useState`,
 * so every visit to another module handed the filter back to detection — silently, and looking
 * exactly like the app changing its mind about your loadout. It is on the RESTART tier now
 * (`eq.gear.classes`), and the THREE-VALUED shape is what needed the care: `null` is FOLLOWING and
 * an empty list is PINNED TO NOTHING, which are different statements and are stored differently
 * (the key is absent for the first). `sanitizeGearClasses` owns that distinction and the closed
 * allowlist; this hook only decides what to write.
 *
 * IT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* SHARED WITH `eq.planner.classes`, the Exaltations browser's own trio.
 * Two surfaces, two questions: the browse filter is "who am I collecting exaltations for" and this
 * one is "who am I reading the gear table for", and JOS-302 made this one NARROW the corpus while
 * that one still only lights chips. Folding them onto one key would make a click on either tab
 * silently re-filter the other.
