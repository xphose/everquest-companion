// gear/GearView.tsx — THE GEAR TAB (JOS-284, phase 3 of the gear planner).
//
// WHAT IT IS. A searchable, sortable, filterable table over the whole candidate index — 6,766
// equippable items, every one of them described in numbers (`GearRow`, phase 2). SEARCH IS THE
// WHOLE SURFACE (owner ruling, JOS-325): no plan and no selection is needed to use it. You open
// the tab and you are looking at the corpus.
//
// THE PIPELINE IS THREE MEMOS, IN THIS ORDER, AND THE ORDER IS THE FEATURE:
//
//     scaleAll(rows, plusState)  →  filterGearRows(…)  →  sortGearRows(…)
//
// The global plus-state selector changes what every row IS, so filtering and sorting run on the
// SCALED numbers — ask for "ratio at least 1.0" under a +5 slider and you get the weapons that
// reach 1.0 AT +5, which is the question the control exists to ask. Splitting it into three memos
// is what keeps each keystroke cheap: a search keystroke re-runs the filter and the sort but never
// re-scales 6,766 rows, and a header click re-runs only the sort.
//
// TWO DEFERRALS, ONE LAW. The search box echoes instantly and the FILTER runs on
// `useDeferredValue(text)` — the standing search law, with the lowercase key precomputed once in
// `gearData.toRow`. The plus-state slider obeys the SAME law for the same reason, and the state is
// deferred as a STRING (`"2:3"`) rather than as the `{full, fraction}` object: `useDeferredValue`
// compares by identity, so deferring a fresh object every render would defer nothing at all, and
// deferring the two numbers separately could tear into a combination neither slider was ever in.
// One primitive, parsed back on the other side.
//
// THE LIST IS WINDOWED AND THE BOX IS BOUNDED. `useWindowedRows` keeps the mounted DOM at about a
// screenful whether the filter matches 12 rows or 6,766, and the table lives inside its own
// fixed-height scroller so a growing list never grows the page (the standing UI law).
//
// AND SINCE JOS-285 (phase 4) IT SAYS WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE. The ownership join hangs off exactly
// the seam phase 3 left — `row.key` is `itemKey(name)` is `ownershipKey` — so the OWNED column is
// one map lookup per rendered row and the "Owned or looted" filter is one injected predicate,
// beside the era one. Two things are deliberately NOT restated here: the dump's age (the
// `/outputfile` freshness line owns both instants — JOS-253/268) and the keyring exclusion (the
// fold owns the roster; this tab only reports what the fold left out of the player's own file).
//
// THE SETS ARE GONE, AND SEARCH IS NOW THE WHOLE TAB (JOS-325, owner ruling 2026-08-13). JOS-286
// hung a second document off this view — named virtual loadouts in a pane beside the table, a `+`
// on every row to fill them, a totals block, a diff against the body. It is all removed: the pane,
// the chip that opened it, the per-row `+` and the `onAssign` plumbing that carried it into
// `GearTable`. ACQUISITION PLANNING IS THE WISH LIST'S JOB NOW (JOS-326), one tab over in the same
// gear area, and this view answers exactly one question again — what is out there, and what of it
// do I already have.
//
// NOTHING ABOVE THIS PARAGRAPH CHANGED FOR IT, and that is the shape of the removal rather than a
// happy accident: the sets were additive from the day they shipped (the tab always mounted with no
// set, no plan and no selection), so taking them out is a deletion and never a rewrite. The three
// memos, both deferrals, the windowing, the columns picker, the controls picker, the era/owned/
// class/slot/weapon filters and the global plus-state slider are byte-for-byte the surface JOS-302
// and JOS-297 left. THE STORED SETS ARE UNTOUCHED TOO — `ProgressState.gearSets` is retired from
// the UI and kept on disk (progressState.ts holds the ruling); this view simply no longer asks for
// it.
//
// AND SINCE JOS-297 YOU CHOOSE WHAT IS ON SCREEN — the columns and the filter controls both, each
// remembered in `localStorage` (`useGearPrefs`). The two choices meet the pipeline above at two
// different points, and which point is the whole design:
//
//   * the CONTROLS choice meets it FIRST. `inertFilters` forces every hidden control's field to the
//     value that does not filter, BEFORE the filter memo sees it — so a control that is not on
//     screen cannot be holding rows back, and the empty state can never name a toggle nobody can
//     find. The user's own value is kept in `own` and comes back untouched when the control does.
//   * the COLUMNS choice meets it LAST, at `columnsFor`, which draws either the user's list or the
//     derived seed. It changes what is DISPLAYED and nothing that is computed — the same rows, in
//     the same order, at the same plus-state.
//
// The plus-state is the one control on both sides of that line: hiding it does not merely remove a
// slider, it puts the corpus back at base, because a simulation nobody can see or cancel is a quiet
// lie. THAT CLAUSE USED TO END "…the quiet lie `useUpgradeState` refuses to persist for exactly the
// same reason", and the second half of it is retired: JOS-329's owner ruling persists the slider.
// The clamp above is untouched and is now the whole of that defence — a plus-state you cannot see
// is put back to base, and a plus-state you CAN see says what it is (`gearData.useUpgradeState`
// carries the overruled law and the argument that answers it).
//
// AND SINCE JOS-329 NOTHING ON THIS TAB IS LOST TO A TAB SWITCH (owner report 2026-08-13: *we're
// losing everything right now*). A view unmounts on every switch, and until this ticket only the
// two JOS-297 chips were written down — the filters, the search box, the class pin, the sort and
// the slider were all `useState`, so a glance at the Loot tab reset the whole form. All five go
// through `useAreaMemory` now, on the tier `areaMemory.AREA_FORM_TIER` assigns them: the structural
// picks survive a restart, the search box lasts the session. THE PIPELINE ABOVE DID NOT CHANGE FOR
// IT — the three memos, both deferrals and both JOS-297 meeting points are byte-for-byte what they
// were, because where a field is STORED is not a question the filter model has ever asked.
//
// AND SINCE JOS-335 A SEARCH ROW CAN BE WANTED. The sentence three paragraphs up — "ACQUISITION
// PLANNING IS THE WISH LIST'S JOB NOW" — was true and only half wired: the Exaltations donor rows
// could write a wish (JOS-326) and the 6,766 rows of this table could not, so the tab that IS the
// item corpus was the one surface with no way to say "I want that". The gesture is per row and the
// door is the one every other writer uses (`useWishlist` → `addWish` → the same character-scoped
// document), so there is no second model, no second dedupe and nothing here that knows how a wish
// is stored. The pipeline above is untouched again: a wish is not a filter, so the three memos
// never see it — `wished` is read straight off the loaded document and joined to the rows in the
// TABLE, by `row.key`, which is `itemKey(name)`, which is `WishEntry.itemKey` (phase 3's seam, for
// the third time).
//
// AND SINCE JOS-343 THE GESTURE GOES BOTH WAYS, AND IT IS THE EXALTATIONS CONTROL (owner ruling
// 2026-08-13, one day after JOS-335 shipped a heart). The row's control is the donor row's — the
// same component, `features/wishlist/WishToggle.tsx` — and a second click on a row already on the
// list REMOVES the wish through `useWishlist.remove`, the Wish list tab's own deletion. Everything
// the paragraph above says is still true; what changed is that this table now writes the document
// in both directions instead of one, and `useGearWishes` is where both doors are.
//
// AND SINCE JOS-338 A ROW SAYS WHAT IT WOULD REPLACE. Phase 4 taught the table whether you OWN a
// candidate; hovering one now opens a card with the item's numbers, what is in each CELL that item
// would occupy (`useGearCompare`, over the `plannerInventory` seam — gearData.ts argues the choice),
// and how old the dump making that claim is. It is outside the three-memo pipeline for the same
// reason the wish list is: what you are wearing is not a filter. The JOS-143 law the table has
// carried since it shipped is narrowed rather than broken, and GearTable.tsx's header states how.
//
// MOUNTED HERE, AND WHAT MAKES THAT SAFE IS THE HOOK RATHER THAN THE ROUTER (JOS-346). This used
// to read: the three tabs are siblings, App renders one view at a time, so two `useWishlist` mounts
// never coexist and the remount is what re-reads a wish removed on another tab. The premise held
// and the promise did not — a per-mount copy made the refresh depend on view lifecycle and on a
// fire-and-forget write beating the next view's read. `useWishlist` holds ONE document for the
// window now, so this table's controls are reading the same object the Wish list tab edits, and
// they were correct before this view was ever rebuilt.
//
// AND SINCE JOS-302 THE FIRST TOOLBAR ROW NARROWS HARDER, in three ways the pipeline above did not
// change one line for. The CLASS picks remove rows instead of chipping them (the owner's ruling —
// gearFilter.ts `GearFilters.classes` holds the argument, GearTable.tsx holds the deleted chip's
// tombstone); the SLOT picker is a multi-select whose picks UNION; and a WEAPON TYPE picker joins
// it, unioning over the nine skills the corpus states plus the three categories that span them.
// All three are ordinary fields of `GearFilters`, so they AND with era, owned, effect, ratio and
// the thresholds exactly as everything else does — the only thing this file had to learn is that a
// third filter can now be the reason the table is empty (`emptyText`, and the pass that counts it).
