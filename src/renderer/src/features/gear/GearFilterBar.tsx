// gear/GearFilterBar.tsx — the Gear tab's two toolbar rows.
//
// TWO ROWS, EACH `nowrap`, AND THAT IS THE flexWrap LAW rather than a layout preference: wrapping
// converts content overflow into HEIGHT, so a bar that wraps turns a toolbar into a growing block
// and pushes the table it filters off the bottom of the pane. Two DELIBERATE rows is not wrapping
// — it is a stated shape, and the first holds controls that never shrink beside exactly one thing
// that may (the search box).
//
// THE SPLIT IS BY QUESTION, not by fit. The first row asks WHICH ITEMS — name, slots, weapon type,
// classes, effect kind, era, owned. The second asks WHAT THEY READ, and since JOS-302 that is one
// control: the plus-state being simulated.
//
// THE SECOND ROW USED TO CARRY TWO MORE (owner ruling 2026-08-13: *drop the min-ratio and
// stat-at-least filters completely - sorting services that need without spending toolbar real
// estate*). A `Min ratio` box and a `Stat at least` box that grew a row of removable chips are
// DELETED, controls and predicates both — `gearFilter.ts`'s header states why a sort answers the
// question better, and `gearColumns.ts` states where the chips' second job (conjuring the column)
// went. The row survives because the plus-state slider is still on it and is still a statement
// about what the numbers READ rather than about which rows they belong to.
//
// NO POPPER ON ANY OF IT (JOS-143). The hints are native `title`s: these controls sit directly
// above a dense windowed table, and an interactive MUI Tooltip opened from a chip up here lands on
// the header row and eats the sort click aimed at it.
//
// THREE OF THE FIRST ROW'S CONTROLS ARE THE SAME CONTROL (JOS-302). Slots, weapon types and classes
// are all "pick several from a closed list, and the picks UNION" — so all three are
// `components/ChipMultiSelect`, with the same keyboard behaviour and the same chips-in-the-field
// shape. The slot control used to be a single-pick select and the owner asked for the classes
// control's behaviour instead; giving it literally that control is the cheapest way to keep the
// promise.
//
// THE CLASS FILTER NARROWS THE CORPUS HERE (owner ruling 2026-08-13, JOS-302) — it is no longer the
// "filter and never a rule" the V2 law describes, and there is no "Usable by these" toggle and no
// off-filter chip on a search row any more. It still shows what the app currently infers you are
// running; touching it PINS your choice, and detection may then only OFFER — the "detected: …"
// chip, one click and reversible. The V2 law is untouched where it was written for: a donor already
// PLACED in a build still gets `MismatchChip` (PlanCell, FarmList), because there the row is a
// decision you made and removing it would be deleting it. `gearFilter.ts GearFilters.classes` holds
// the full argument.
//
// AND SINCE JOS-297 THE BAR IS CONFIGURABLE (owner feedback: *we should be able to customize which
// filters we see*). `visible` is the set of controls to draw — the whole vocabulary while the user
// has not said otherwise, so the shipped bar is what an untouched install still gets. Two rules
// hold it honest. A control that is not drawn is not FILTERING either: `gearPrefs.inertFilters`
// forces its field inert upstream, so this file only has to decide what to render. And a row whose
// every control is hidden is not RENDERED — an empty `Stack` is still a gap, and the two rows'
// whole contract is that they cost fixed height rather than growing (the `flexWrap` law above).
