// useOverviewLeveling — the Overview tab's read of the `progression` module.
//
// The SAME module and the SAME delta reducer the Leveling tab uses (`applyProgressionDelta`,
// re-exported from features/leveling/progressionDelta) — deliberately not a second copy. That
// reducer encodes a four-step contract (close the open zone interval, append, front-drop, replace
// scalars) that is subtle enough that a re-implementation here would drift silently and show two
// different pasts on two tabs. There is never a second concurrent subscriber either: `ViewContent`
// in App.tsx mounts exactly one feature view at a time.
//
// ALL the arithmetic lives in `overviewLevelingData.ts` (pure, node-tested). This file is only
// the transport plus ONE memo — keyed on the snapshot's identity, which is exactly right for
// `useModule`: every delta produces a brand-new snapshot object and nothing else ever mutates
// one, so the two `rangeStats` sweeps run once per delta rather than once per render.

/**
 * The leveling card's whole state. Pre-hydration the module hook returns null and
 * `EMPTY_PROGRESSION` stands in — which derives to `empty: true`, the card's quiet state, and
 * never to a zero rate.
 *
 * The SECOND module (JOS-192) is `character`, for one field: the level the log last STATED. The
 * ding series alone is silent across a loadout swap — it re-reports the new class's level only
 * when that loadout next dings — and `character` carries your own `/who` row's number, which is
 * the one thing a player can do to correct it. Cheap: that module pushes a delta only when the
 * character, the zone or the level actually moves.
