// LevelingCard — "how fast am I actually progressing, right now", and the way down to the
// Leveling tab.
//
// It shows DELIBERATELY LESS than that tab: no charts, no drag-selected range, no AA ledger, no
// per-zone table. A ROW OF TILES (level, the last hour's pace, AA, next level), one sparkline of
// that hour, and the lines that qualify them. If you want any of the rest, that is what the link
// is for.
//
// THE AA LINE IS THE ONE THING THAT KEEPS WORKING AT THE CAP. Every other number here is built
// on stated level-bar percentages, and the game stops stating them at max level — the headline
// becomes an em-dash and the card goes quiet exactly when AA becomes the whole game. So the same
// window carries an AA read (completions/hr · points/hr · the inferred wait for the next one),
// shaped by the Leveling tab's own `aaPaceLine` so the two surfaces cannot word one hour two
// ways. It is a LINE and not a tile because the wait is a model and a tile row is where this
// card puts facts. The wait says so in ONE WORD ('est.'): the tab's tile carries the chip and
// the full account of what the log did and did not state, and repeating that here would be a
// footnote where a caption belongs. No AA in the hour ⇒ no line at all, never em-dashes.
//
// WHY TILES AND NOT A SENTENCE (owner request, 2026-08-04). The card used to be four stacked
// lines of prose with one big number in the middle, and the reader had to parse a sentence to
// find each fact. A tile is the same fact with the number given the whole of the reader's
// attention and the words demoted to a caption — and, load-bearing here, a MISSING fact is
// visibly missing rather than an em-dash mid-sentence. The tiles come from
// `overviewLevelingTiles.ts` already built and already filtered: this component chooses no
// content at all, which is what keeps every one of those rules under a node test.
//
// THE SPARKLINE IS THE LEVELING CHART'S OWN LANGUAGE. Twelve five-minute columns of stated
// progress, each tinted with `zoneBands.zoneColor` — so the camp you spent forty minutes in is
// the same hue here, on the Leveling tab's band strip, and in that tab's per-zone table. It is a
// tiny inline SVG for the same reason the perf popover's is (PerfChip.tsx): twelve numbers do
// not need a chart library, and the shape is the whole message — "was this hour steady, or one
// good pull and then nothing".
//
// THE HEADLINE IS THE LAST HOUR **OF THE LOG**, not of the wall clock (`overviewLevelingData`
// anchors on `snap.lastTs`). Someone reading this card has usually alt-tabbed out of the game;
// a wall-clock hour would empty itself the moment they stopped playing and report the result as
// a rate. The zone line's "since <time>" is the one clock-shaped thing here, and it states an
// instant the log actually recorded.
//
// AN EM-DASH IS A REAL ANSWER. A null rate renders as '—' and never as '0.00': at the level cap
// the game prints experience lines with no percentage at all, so the window's progress is
// genuinely unknown rather than zero, and the `at cap` chip says which unknown it is. The
// sparkline obeys the same rule from the other side — an hour whose every experience line stated
// no percentage draws NO bars and says so, because twelve zero-height columns would claim a
// measured-quiet hour that was never measured.
//
// The words are the feature's words: "levels of progress", never xp; "idle", never AFK. And
// "offline" ONLY when the log said so: the hour can contain a logout (the card's window is an
// hour of LOG time, so coming back at 13:00 after camping at 02:52 puts most of an empty chair
// inside it), and when a login line closes one, a chip states it and every rate on the card
// divides by the ONLINE part of the hour. A logout still in progress has no login line yet, so
// it cannot be seen at all and its silence stays idle — the chip's tooltip says that too.
//
// THE PROJECTION IS A TILE WHEN IT EXISTS AND A LINE WHEN IT DOES NOT. "~2h 10m / to level 44"
// is the answer this card was asked for, so it gets a tile; a REFUSAL is a sentence, because the
// reason is the answer and a tile cannot carry one. Either way the same tooltip slot says why:
// the game states a percentage per experience gain and never your position in the bar, so
// without an observed level-up — or with an at-cap line anywhere since one — how far into the
// bar you are is genuinely unknown.
//
// The `~` is not decoration. This projects ONE hour of your play forward and assumes it repeats:
// same mobs, same camp, same share of medding. It is not a countdown to a known instant, and
// past a day it stops pretending to minutes and says '>1 day'.
