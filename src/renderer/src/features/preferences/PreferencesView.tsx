// PreferencesView — the app's single settings surface (Task #55).
//
// Replaces the old SettingsDialog (EQ install folder) and the drawer's update-channel
// selector: everything app-level lives here, reached from the drawer's bottom-aligned
// "Preferences" item, the title-bar gear, and the fresh-machine empty state.
//
// Layout: a [section rail | content] split, where the rail is a TRUE SWITCHER — one
// section is mounted at a time. (It was originally a scroll-spy page: every section
// rendered at once and the rail called scrollIntoView. Inside the app's overflow:auto
// content area the scroll barely moved and `active` never followed, so the rail read
// as dead and the tab as one endless column. That machinery is gone.)
//
// A DEEP LINK LANDS VISIBLY. `section` switches the rail silently, which is the wrong
// ending for a sentence the user clicked somewhere else ("Set up in Preferences", the
// telemetry notice's details link): the page arrives and nothing says which of these cards
// was the answer. The landed section's cards PULSE on arrival and settle — that lives in
// ./PrefSectionBlock.tsx, together with the card it decorates.
//
// SEARCH IS AN EXPLICIT MODE, not the default rendering. The field sits at the top of
// the content column so it lines up with the cards it filters; it echoes instantly from
// local state and filters a DEFERRED copy (AGENTS.md search pattern). While the query is
// non-empty the content column shows matches from EVERY section, each still under its
// section overline so a hit always carries its context; section labels match too, so
// typing "updates" pulls that whole section in. The rail keeps listing every section,
// dims the ones with no matches, and clicking any row exits search mode back to that
// section.
//
// Sections:
//   Game     — EverQuest install-folder discovery/override (effective path + how it
//             resolved + a folder picker + character-log validation). Lives in
//             ./EqFolderSetting.tsx, like Updates does — this file only names it.
//   Appearance — how big things are drawn and how see-through the floating windows are (JOS-123,
//             JOS-405, JOS-407, named and reshaped by JOS-408). TWO items: `In-app text size`, the
//             main window's zoom as an A− / A+ over the five-stop ladder, applied on the press; and
//             `Overlays`, ONE card carrying a single `Independent per overlay` switch and then
//             EITHER two shared steppers (text size, transparency) OR the twelve per-overlay rows —
//             never both, because a control that is on screen while it governs nothing is the
//             pattern the owner's 2026-08-17 review threw out. Second in the rail on purpose. Lives
//             in ./TextSizeSetting.tsx (descriptor and the in-app card) plus
//             ./OverlaysAppearanceSetting.tsx; the section id is still `textsize`, because it is
//             what the rail testid, the deep link and the e2e steps address it by. The steppers and
//             sliders on the overlays themselves are unchanged and write the same values — this is
//             where a player who pinned their meters can reach them at all.
//   Combat   — the meters' two shaping choices: WHOSE damage they show (You / Group / Everyone,
//             default Everyone since JOS-229 — JOS-115 moved it here off every combat surface,
//             JOS-229 changed which way it opens) and where the
//             pet's damage sits. Lives in ./CombatSection.tsx, descriptor and all.
//   Overlays — when the floating meters get out of the way: hide them while EverQuest isn't
//             running (on by default) and/or while it isn't the window you're in (off).
//             Lives in ./OverlayAutoHideSetting.tsx. Plus the celebration toast's controls — and
//             the opt-in drag magnetism (JOS-217, ./OverlaySnapSetting.tsx), which is HELD OUT of
//             this release and therefore not built into the section at all (JOS-359).
//   Graphics — the two compatibility switches for a machine whose graphics driver dislikes what
//             this app draws: software rendering (next launch) and solid, non-transparent
//             overlays (next overlay open). Lives in ./GraphicsSetting.tsx, descriptor and all.
//   Cursor ring — the opt-in white halo that follows the mouse over the EQ window (off by
//             default; size + thickness). Lives in ./CursorRingSetting.tsx.
//   Voice    — spoken alerts (docs/plans/voice-alerts.md §2): engine tier, default voice +
//             preview, speed and volume. There is no master switch — an alert's own output is
//             what makes it speak (schema v8). Lives in ./VoiceSetting.tsx.
//   Profiles — export your GLOBAL settings as a paste-safe share string / file, and import
//             someone else's ADDITIVELY (see src/shared/profiles.ts for the data model).
//   Updates — app version, last-checked time, a manual check, background download
//             progress, and the "Relaunch to update" action when one is waiting.
//             Lives in ./UpdateSetting.tsx; this file only names it in the table.
//   What's new — the browsable release history, newest first, with everything since this
//             install last read it marked new. A reading surface with no controls, which is why
//             it is a section rather than a line under Updates (the same argument Performance
//             and Usage analytics make). Lives in ../whatsnew/WhatsNewPanel.tsx, descriptor and
//             all; the Version row above links straight to it.
//   Usage analytics — the anonymous-counts switch, the rotatable id, and the payload
//             viewer that makes the privacy claim checkable. ./TelemetrySetting.tsx.
//   Performance — the title-bar CPU/memory HUD switch (off by default) and the read-only
//             breakdown of how long this launch's startup took, phase by phase.
//             Lives in ./PerfSetting.tsx.
//   Feedback — the second entry point into the feedback DIALOG (the first is the nav
//             drawer's footer). Feedback is not a view, so this section only opens it.
//   Thanks   — whose pictures these are (JOS-198). The app SHIPS ~3.75 MB of item icons and boss
//             portraits copied from two volunteer-run wikis; this is where it says so, links
//             them, and states the consequence a user cares about (they are on your machine, and
//             drawing them asks nobody for anything). Lives in ./ThanksSetting.tsx, descriptor
//             and all. Last in the rail on purpose — see the table.

/**
 * THE PANE, GATED (JOS-340).
 *
 * A control never paints a value it does not know, and every card in here reads a store that
 * lives in MAIN over a promise-only bridge — so the honest arrangement is that NOTHING in the
 * pane renders until one batched read has landed. See ./prefsHydration.tsx for why this is a
 * gate rather than a synchronous preload snapshot, and why the wait is invisible after the first
 * time: the snapshot is cached for the renderer's life, so every later rail click and every trip
 * back to this tab paints the right value on its first frame with no wait at all.
 *
 * The gate wraps the WHOLE pane, heading and rail included, rather than only the content column.
 * A rail that appeared a frame before its cards would be a second, smaller version of the same
 * jump — and there is nothing to look at in an empty pane anyway.
