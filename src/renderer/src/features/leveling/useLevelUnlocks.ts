// useLevelUnlocks — the renderer's ONE pull of the level-unlock dataset, and the combo join
// every reader of it performs (docs/plans/levelup-whats-new.md).
//
// WHY A MODULE-LEVEL CACHE. The dataset is built in main from two COMPILE-TIME JSONs
// (spells.json + classes.json), so it cannot change while the app runs — there is no delta
// channel to subscribe to and nothing to invalidate. One in-flight promise, shared by every
// caller, means the panel and the always-mounted ding detector cost exactly one IPC between them
// however many times either remounts.
//
// A FAILED PULL IS EMPTY, NEVER A THROW. The panel then renders its "no unlock data" state and
// the toast falls back to celebrating the level alone — the same shapes a class with zero
// unlocks at that level produces, so there is no second failure path to reason about.
