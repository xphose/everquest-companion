// "New at this level" — what a level gave (or will give) THIS loadout
// (docs/plans/levelup-whats-new.md §0, §2). The panel the level-up toast links to.
//
// IT IS BROWSABLE, NOT JUST HISTORICAL. The stepper defaults to the character's current level —
// the question you have the instant you ding — but stepping it answers "what do I get at 30?"
// without waiting for 30. Same data, same join, no second code path.
//
// THE COMBO IS JOINED AT READ (law 10) and never guessed at (law 1). Chips are FILLED for the
// classes the module has actually resolved and OUTLINED for candidates of a slot it has only
// narrowed; when any slot is unresolved the header says `~ambiguous` and the lists are honestly
// an upper bound — the classes you might be running, not the ones you are.
//
// A LOADOUT WITH NO SPELLS IS NOT AN ERROR. BER, MNK and WAR have zero Template:Spellpage spells
// (measured, wave O1): their spells list is empty at every level and says so in words, while the
// skills list carries everything they actually gain.
//
// AND THE WAY OUT IS ON SCREEN WHETHER OR NOT THE LOADOUT IS KNOWN (JOS-192, trigger report
// 01KZP6SDZJK6BPEWA4Z0MF5ANG). This panel pointed at the fix ONLY in its loadout-UNKNOWN state —
// so a reporter looking at three classes they had stopped playing was shown the wrong answer
// confidently and offered nothing. It now wears the same PROVENANCE chip the Profiles panel and
// the character header use, and that chip's `inferred` tooltip names the two moves that correct
// it. `inferred` is a claim about evidence, and a surface that never says so is asking to be
// believed.
//
// THE POINTER IS A TOOLTIP AND NOT A LINE, and it stays one for the reason it was CHOSEN rather
// than the reason it was forced. The forcing is gone: this panel used to be the last child of a
// `height: 100%` stack whose middle child was the scroller, so every pixel it took came out of the
// charts — one caption line here once pushed the timeslice control under the panel above it at the
// app's minimum width, and leveling.e2e.mts hit-tests exactly that. Since JOS-289 the page scrolls
// and the height budget is not zero. The tooltip stays anyway: this is a chip's provenance, which
// is what the tooltip diet is FOR.
//
// AND WHAT THIS SERVER HAS NOT OPENED IS NOT NEW AT THIS LEVEL (JOS-393). The spell list folds the
// rows eqlwiki badges out of era behind a `+N out of era` disclosure — the drops precedent, the same
// phrase — so a level-50 shaman is no longer told `Sloths Healing` (`{{Kunark Era}}`) is his. The
// SEARCH below is untouched by the fold and marks those rows instead: a search is a question the
// player asked, and the honest answer to it includes the spell and says what it is.
//
// AND THE LISTS BELOW ARE AS TALL AS THEY NEED TO BE (JOS-289). `UnlockList` was a 120px windowed
// porthole — the surface the owner named as cramped — and is now plain rows at their honest
// height, with the full `SpellTooltip` card behind every spell name.
//
// A TOAST'S DEEP LINK NOW LANDS ON THIS PANEL RATHER THAN NEAR IT (JOS-330). The two consequences
// of the layout above met here: the page is one tall scroller and this panel is the BOTTOM of the
// left column, so a link that mounted the tab and set the level left the reader at the top of a
// screen of charts with the answer a screen and a half below the fold. `useFocusLanding` (its own
// file, and its header carries the reasoning) scrolls this Paper fully into the app's one scroller
// and pulses its edge for two seconds on arrival — on EVERY link, including a repeat of the same
// level, and on no plain tab switch at all.
