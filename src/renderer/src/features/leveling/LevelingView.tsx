              2026-08-13). Two laws meet here and both are load-bearing:

              STILL ONE POSITION IN THE TREE, whatever the charts do. This is the one surface on
              the tab that needs no log at all — "what do I get at 30" is answered by the committed
              DBs — so it renders in the chart-less state too, and it is the wrapper above, not the
              conditional, that guarantees it. Writing it into both arms of that conditional would
              remount it every time the charts appeared and drop a level-up toast's deep link
              (focusLevel/focusNonce) on the way. It is the second child of a box that is always
              there, so React reconciles it in place across the flip.

              NO LONGER LAST ON THE PAGE. It used to sit outside the row entirely, full width, on
              the argument that the two plots deserve the top of the tab and a browsable reference
              panel should not push them down a screen. That argument still holds — this is below
              the charts, not above them — but the owner ruled its cost worse than its benefit: the
              charts column ends well short of the ledger/drops/feed column, and a full-width panel
              underneath left an enormous hole at the bottom left of the tab. Filling that hole is
              what this placement is for. The consequence, stated so the specs can measure it: the
              tab's deepest pixel is now usually the RIGHT column's, so scrolling the page to the
              very bottom no longer guarantees this panel is in frame. */}
