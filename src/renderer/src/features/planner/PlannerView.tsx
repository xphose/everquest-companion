// planner/PlannerView.tsx — the EXALTATIONS tab: SEARCH, and nothing else (JOS-326).
//
// THE TAB IS CALLED EXALTATIONS (owner, 2026-08-06, JOS-42). "Planner" named what the surface did
// for us; "Exaltations" names the game system a player came here about. The rename is a LABEL —
// the `planner` view id, its route, its `eq.planner.*` keys and every `planner-*` testid are
// unchanged, because renaming those would be a refactor with no user on the other end of it.
//
// WHAT THIS TICKET TOOK OUT, AND WHY THAT LEAVES THE SURFACE BETTER. The tab used to be a shell
// around three modes over a SELECTED SET: Effects picked what you wanted, Inventory laid it over
// the gear you were wearing, Farm turned what was missing into a route. The set switcher, the
// three-mode toggle, the board (PlanBoard/PlanCell/HostPicker) and the Farm rollup are all gone.
// What remains is the one thing a player actually comes to this tab to do — LOOK SOMETHING UP —
// and the thing they do next now has a surface of its own, one tab over.
//
// THE BROWSER IS RETAINED WHOLESALE, WHICH IS THE HARD CONSTRAINT OF THE TICKET. Every grouping
// axis, every donor row, the class and era filters, the non-equippable escape hatch, the item
// narrowing, the detected-classes chip and the search box are exactly what they were. Nothing that
// could find something was allowed to be lost in the removal; the only capability that went is the
// one whose destination no longer exists (writing a socket of a cell of a set).
//
// SO THE ADD BUTTON GOES SOMEWHERE ELSE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE SEAM BETWEEN THE TWO TABS. A donor
// row's action used to be "add to set" (which cell? replacing what?); it is now "add to wish list",
// which is one click and is deduped by the item — so the browse answers "what do I want" and the
// Wish list answers "and where do I go and get it".
//
// …AND SINCE JOS-343 IT IS A TOGGLE, which retires the "cannot destroy anything" half of that
// sentence rather than qualifying it (owner ruling 2026-08-13). A donor already on the list reads
// REMOVE and a second click takes it off, through `useWishlist.remove` — the Wish list tab's own
// deletion, not a second one. The control is now literally the same component the gear search row
// draws (`features/wishlist/WishToggle.tsx`), which is the parity the ruling was about.
//
// THE EXALTPLANS STORE IS STILL ON DISK AND STILL SERVED. Nothing in this file reads it any more;
// the wish list's one-time seed does, which is how the sockets somebody planned survive the board
// that drew them (features/wishlist/wishSeed.ts).
//
// ONE NOWRAP TOOLBAR ROW (the flexWrap law) — much shorter than it was: the class filter, the
// disagree chip when detection has something to offer, and the permanent `?`, which since JOS-51
// is the ONLY way the rules card ever appears (V10).
