// mobSearch.ts — fuzzy search over this launch's mob catalog, in the renderer (Task #64).
//
// Bootstrap installs main's active snapshot before this module loads. Downloaded updates wait
// for the next app launch, so search, map pins, drop sources and engine lookups share one set
// of facts throughout the session. Individual searches need no IPC and work offline.
//
// SAME SCORER AS FIGHT SEARCH, deliberately: `shared/fuzzy.ts` is the extracted core of
// `main/combat/fightSearch.ts` (Task #61), so a typo'd query behaves identically in both boxes
// ("gohul knigt" finds the ghoul knights either way). One set of rules, one set of tests.
//
// HAYSTACK = name + zones. That is what a player types: either the thing ("ghoul knight") or
// where it lives ("lower guk"), usually a bit of both. The page TITLE is deliberately not in
// it — it is the name again, plus a disambiguating "(Lake Rathe)" the zone already supplies.
//
// PERFORMANCE. A linear scan, like fightSearch, and for the same reason. MEASURED over the REAL
// catalog (7,866 entries, throwaway probe, 2026-08-03), warm, per call:
//
//   "gohul knigt" 2.80 ms   "freprot" 3.62 ms   "lower guk" 2.76 ms   "a" 2.19 ms
//   "dragon slayer nothing" (0 hits) 3.45 ms
//
// — all of it inside a per-keystroke budget, and the box filters on a deferred value anyway, so
// an inverted index would be complexity bought with nothing. Tokens are built ONCE, LAZILY, on
// the first search (never at module load — the Mobs tab may never be opened this session). The
// catalog is immutable, so the token arrays live for the window's lifetime.

import type { MobEntry, MobKnowledge } from '@shared/types'
// RELATIVE, not `@shared/fuzzy`, and deliberately: this is a VALUE import, and the alias only
// exists inside the vite build. Spelling the path keeps this module importable by the node test
// runner (`tests/mobSearch.test.mts` scores the REAL 7,866-entry catalog), the same reason
// mobLookupLocal.ts is split out of mobLookup.ts. Type-only imports are erased, so they keep
// the alias. If a fourth file needs this, teach tsx the paths instead of spreading this.

/**
 * The catalog row as a knowledge record — the renderer's mirror of main's
 * `knowledgeFromCatalog`, over the identical JSON.
 *
 * COMPACT BY DESIGN, and honest about it: the catalog carries item NAMES only, so a per-drop
 * `rarity` is simply ABSENT here rather than invented. The live lookup is where one comes from,
 * and the page merges the two.
 *
 * AND NO ERA EVIDENCE EITHER (JOS-377), for the same kind of reason: `MobDrop.eraTag` comes off
 * the ITEM page and the 11k-item corpus that holds it is main-only, so these drops arrive with the
 * era fields absent. That is not a hole in the fold — the fold's layer 1 is the mob catalog, which
 * `donorEra` inverts from the item KEY, so a pinned row still gets a real zone answer; what it
 * cannot see is the banner, which is the witness a REVAMP defeats. The mob page therefore prefers
 * main's annotated list whenever the lookup resolved the same page (`MobPage.pinIdentity`), and a
 * record that never gets one renders as `era?` rather than as a verdict (law 1).
 *
 * SEARCH ITSELF IS UNTOUCHED BY ANY OF THIS. `searchMobs` matches over NAME + ZONES (see the
 * haystack above), never over drop names, so an out-of-era drop cannot pull a mob into the results
 * in the first place — and if it ever did, it should: finding where a thing drops is not a lie,
 * and the ROW is where the chip would go, not the query.
