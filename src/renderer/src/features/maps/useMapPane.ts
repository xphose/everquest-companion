// The sidebar's STATE — its query, its filtered lists, and which row is selected.
//
// IT LIVES ABOVE THE PANE, not inside it, and that is the whole reason this file exists: the
// pane LISTS the mobs and the surface PINS them, and both must be showing the same set. Typing
// "sarnak" has to narrow the map and the list together, so the filtered rows are derived exactly
// once, here, and handed to both. A pane that owned its own query would need a callback back up
// to the surface, and the two would be one render out of step forever.
//
// EVERYTHING IS DERIVED FROM THE DATA, NEVER FROM THE QUERY. `mobRows` walks the 7,866-row
// catalog and `labelRows` walks the map's points; both are memoized on the zone / the points, so
// a keystroke re-filters an array that already exists. The catalog scan is the expensive half and
// it runs once per zone (MEASURED precedent: the same join costs ~3ms on the Mobs tab).
//
// THE SELECTION IS A ROW ID, not a coordinate. Ids survive re-filtering (the ring stays on the
// row you clicked while you keep typing) and they are cleared when the map changes, because a
// mob id means nothing in another zone.
