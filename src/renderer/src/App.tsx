 * list arriving, the live dot, the feedback dialog opening and closing — and every one of those
 * used to walk the whole tree. Opening the feedback dialog is the clearest case: a dialog that
 * renders in a portal was re-rendering the Combat meter behind it.
 *
 * `PlainView` deliberately gets NO memo of its own. It sits inside this boundary and takes the
