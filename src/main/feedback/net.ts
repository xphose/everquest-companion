// feedback/net.ts — the ONLY place this feature knows a hostname, and the boundary that
// decides where a user's log slice is allowed to go.
//
// TWO THINGS LIVE HERE, and both are security surface:
//
//  1. `FEEDBACK_API_URL` — the ingest endpoint, compiled in. It ships EMPTY (the feature is
//     "dark") until the Terraform root is applied. An empty value is not a failure mode: it
//     means "this build has no feedback endpoint", which the dialog reports honestly and
//     which makes a network call structurally impossible.
//
//     There is NO user-configurable endpoint override, and there must never be one. An
//     overridable ingest URL turns "attach my log" into "attach my log to a host of the
//     attacker's choosing" — it is an exfiltration primitive, not a convenience. Moving to a
//     custom domain later is a one-line change plus a release; that debt is accepted on
//     purpose (docs/plans/feedback-triage.md §6.2).
//
//  2. `allowedUploadUrl()` — the presigned upload URL comes back from the SERVER. It is
//     remote-supplied text that the main process is about to POST a file to, which is exactly
//     the class of input `security.ts allowedExternalUrl` exists for. So it gets the same
//     rigor: https only, no credentials, default port, no query/fragment, and an EXACT
//     hostname match against the two legal S3 spellings for OUR bucket in OUR region. Never
//     `endsWith`/`includes` — `our-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com.evil.com` must fail, and
//     it does (tests/feedbackNet.test.mts pins every shape).
//
//     It lives beside the feature rather than inside `security.ts` so this wave's file
//     ownership stays disjoint and `tests/security.test.mts` stays untouched as a signal that
//     the boundary was not weakened. Consolidating it into security.ts later is a fine,
//     deliberate follow-up.
//
// All network here is MAIN-PROCESS ONLY. The renderer performs no fetch/XHR — `connect-src
// 'self'` in index.html already makes that structurally impossible, and this feature requires
// ZERO CSP changes. An agent who finds themselves wanting to widen `connect-src` for feedback
// has made a mistake: the work belongs in this directory.
//
//  3. THE DEV-CHANNEL LOCAL STACK (added for `npm run dev:stack`). The two paragraphs above
//     stand unchanged for every shipped build, and the no-override law is NOT relaxed:
//
//       * The gate is closed unless ALL of these hold: this is an Electron process
//         (`process.versions.electron`), it is NOT packaged (Electron's own `app.isPackaged`
//         definition, computed from `process.execPath` so this module stays Electron-free),
//         it is not an `EQ_E2E=1` run, and `EQ_FEEDBACK_URL` names a LOOPBACK url.
//       * The override is loopback-ONLY (127.0.0.1 / [::1]). §6.2 rejects a configurable
//         endpoint because it is an EXFILTRATION PRIMITIVE — "attach my log" becoming "attach
//         my log to a host of the attacker's choosing". A value that can only ever name the
//         machine the log already lives on cannot exfiltrate anything. That is the entire
//         reason this is safe, and it is why widening it to arbitrary https would NOT be.
//       * It is an ENV VAR read by a developer's own shell, never a user-facing setting, never
//         persisted, and never reachable from the renderer or from a server response.
//       * The packaged build is provably unaffected: with the gate closed the env var is not
//         even read, `FEEDBACK_API_URL` is byte-identical to the compiled constant, and
//         `allowedUploadUrl` behaves exactly as it did before (tests/feedbackNet.test.mts
//         pins both, and pins the gate itself against a constructed PACKAGED fact set).
//
//     What it buys: the whole feedback path — dialog, validation, quota, idempotency, the
//     presign leg, every failure state — is rehearsable against `scripts/dev-feedback-server.mts`
//     with no cloud, no credentials and no deployed anything.
