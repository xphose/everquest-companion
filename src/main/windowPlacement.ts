// windowPlacement — asking the OS what screens exist, and where a window may go on them (JOS-187).
// ============================================================================
//
// The Electron half of `displayFit.ts` (which is the pure geometry, and carries the policy
// argument in its header — read that first). This file does two things and nothing else:
//
//   * it turns `screen`'s displays into the four-number shapes the geometry works in, and
//   * it names the DEFAULT each window falls back to when its remembered rectangle is on no
//     display at all — the overlay's own reserved dock slot (overlayLayout.ts) for an overlay,
//     and "centred on the primary display" for the main window.
//
// It also owns the WATCH. Placement has to be re-decided at two moments, not one: when a window is
// created (the launch after the monitor changed — which is the report's own case, since restarting
// is what re-applied the lost position) and while the app is running (the user unplugs the
// monitor the overlay is on, and nothing in this app would otherwise notice). Both go through the
// same function, so a window can never be created by one rule and corrected by another.
//
// THE SEAM IS DELIBERATELY THE ONLY ONE. Two nearby asks are on the owner's desk and NEITHER is
// built here: pinning overlays to a chosen monitor, and snapping them to a grid. Both are further
// constraints on the same question this file answers — "given what the user wants and what exists,
// where does this window go" — so both land in `overlayFittedBounds` (and, for a snap, on the
// user's own move) without disturbing anything below. Nothing here writes to the store, so a future
// rule can neither be fought by this one nor quietly overwrite what the user chose.
//
// WHY THE WATCH IS DEBOUNCED. A single dock/undock is a BURST of screen events — a removal, an
// addition and several metrics changes as Windows re-lays-out what is left — and the work areas
// are not final until it settles. Reconciling on the first one would place windows against an
// arrangement that is about to change again. The timer is unref'd, so it can never hold the
// process open (AGENTS.md: a main-process timer lands on the next 15.6 ms tick edge, which is
// noise against a 300 ms settle).

 * `stored` that is substantially off screen is fitted, and a rectangle on no display at all falls

 * and never on top of another kind.
 *
 * THE FIT'S DEFAULTS ARE THE OVERLAY'S DEFAULTS — an always-on-top overlay is drawn over the
 * taskbar by design, so a correction that has to move one stops at the physical screen edge rather
 * than above the taskbar. `mainWindowBounds` below asks for the other answer, and says why.
 *
