// Three window populations live here because they share ONE security posture and are
// entangled at teardown (closing the main window destroys the rest):
//
//   - the main app window (frameless, bounds persisted),
//   - the floating overlays (one per OverlayKind, transparent + always-on-top), and
//   - the cursor ring (one transparent click-through window tracking the EQ window).
//
// The module owns their handles. Nothing outside reaches for a BrowserWindow: callers
// push to the renderer through `sendToMain` / `getOverlayWindow`, which keeps the
// null-when-closed lifetime in exactly one place.
//
// `src/main/security.ts` is the PURE half of the trust boundary (URL/pack-id predicates,
// no Electron, pinned by tests/security.test.mts). This file is the half that has to talk
// to Electron: the shared webPreferences object and the per-webContents / per-session
// hardening that installs those predicates.

// Electron default — a default is a decision someone else can change in a major bump, and
// `npm audit`-style reviews read this object, not Electron's changelog.
//
// WHY `sandbox: false` — MEASURED, not assumed. The two preloads are built by electron-vite
// from a two-entry rollup input (src/preload/{index,overlay}.ts) and both import the shared
// `src/shared/ipc.ts` channel registry, so rollup hoists it into
// `out/preload/chunks/ipc-<hash>.js` and each preload begins `require("./chunks/ipc-….js")`.
// A SANDBOXED preload's `require` is NOT Node's: it resolves `electron` plus a small
// polyfilled set (events/timers/url) and nothing else. Flipping this to `true` and running
// `npm run test:e2e` fails exactly there — the harness times out with no UI, and the e2e
// errors.log carries:
//
//   [main:preload-error] module not found: ./chunks/ipc-D4DrnWdv.js
//       at preloadRequire (node:electron/js2c/sandbox_bundle)
//
// i.e. `window.eq` is never installed and the app is silently dead. Nothing in the preloads
// themselves needs Node (they use exactly `contextBridge` + `ipcRenderer` — zero `process`,
// zero `fs`; `grep -c 'process\.' out/preload/index.js` is 0), so this is a PACKAGING blocker,
// not a design one: `sandbox: true` becomes available the moment each preload is emitted as
// ONE self-contained file. That is an electron.vite.config.ts change (a per-entry preload
// build, since rollup will always hoist a module shared by two entries into a chunk), owned
// outside this pass and written up as the top recommendation of the security report.
// `app.enableSandbox()` is blocked by the same finding, for the same reason.
//
// Until then the mitigations that actually matter without the OS sandbox are all on:
// contextIsolation (the preload's Node-capable context is unreachable from page JS), no
// nodeIntegration in any form, a deny-by-default navigation/window-open/webview policy
// (hardenWebContents), permissions denied wholesale (hardenSession), and a CSP with no
// script-src escape hatch in either page.
//
// EXPORTED SINCE JOS-139, and the rule it protects is unchanged. It was module-private on the
// argument that every window in this app is created in this file, which made "never inline a
// second opinion" structural. The tray popover is the one window that could not be created here:
// this file sits exactly at the 400-code-line factoring ceiling, and the repo's answer to a
// ceiling is a split rather than a widened threshold. So the WINDOW moved (src/main/tray.ts) and
// the POSTURE did not — there is still ONE definition, spread in whole, and the export is
// read-only. A new window built with anything but this object is still the drift this section

//
// Separate BrowserWindows that sit transparent + always-on-top over the game. EQ Legends runs
// windowed/borderless — including under its own Fullscreen setting, which is a BORDERLESS
// fullscreen window on this client (JOS-375) — and an always-on-top overlay composites fine over
// either (see AGENTS.md). No native helper app is
// needed — Electron's transparent/frameless + setAlwaysOnTop('screen-saver') +
// setIgnoreMouseEvents covers it.
//
// Three KINDS (Task #54; 'events' in Task #59), each an independent window with its own
// persisted config:
//   - 'fight'   : current-fight meter + FIGHT selector.
//   - 'overall' : zone meter + ZONE-session selector.
//   - 'events'  : the live event log (alerts / notable loot / quest completions).
// All can be open simultaneously. The overlay renderer reads its kind from the ?kind= query on
// its URL so a single overlay.html bundle serves every window.
//
// Two interaction modes per window, persisted in that kind's `locked`:
//   - interactive: normal focusable window, -webkit-app-region drag on the header, resize
//     edges, close/config controls + selector + drill-down visible.
//   - locked (click-through): mouse events pass through to the game via
//     setIgnoreMouseEvents(true) — with NO forwarding and therefore no mouse hook (JOS-370). The
//     hover-revealed pin stays clickable because main flips this call from an off-thread hit test
//     against the rectangles the window still wants (overlayHotZone.ts / overlayHover.ts), not
//     because we sit in the machine's mouse path. Never steals focus. No drilling.

/**
 * Set a kind's click-through state. ONE definition, used by the lock toggle below and by the
 * renderer's fine-grained `overlay:setIgnoreMouse` — two call sites disagreeing about what
 * click-through MEANS would be a performance bug nobody could see.
 *
 * ============================ NOTHING OF OURS HOOKS THE MOUSE (JOS-370) ============================
 * This call used to have a second argument, and removing it is the whole of that ticket.
 *
 * A locked overlay was `setIgnoreMouseEvents(true, {forward:true})`. On Windows, `forward` is
 * implemented with a LOW-LEVEL MOUSE HOOK (WH_MOUSE_LL) installed in the MAIN process — and a
 * low-level hook is not an observer, it is a SYNCHRONOUS STOP on the mouse's own path: every mouse
 * event on the machine, including the ones EverQuest is reading to turn the camera, was delivered
 * through our message loop and waited there. Three consequences, all of them measured or reported:
 *
 *   * ANY STALL OF MAIN BECAME A STALL OF THE MACHINE'S INPUT. A 30 ms hitch in the process that
 *     tails the log, folds combat and answers IPC was a 30 ms freeze of the user's CURSOR and of
 *     in-game mouselook. That is the amplifier this whole perf program (JOS-363..372) was chasing:
 *     our latency stopped being ours.
 *   * WINDOWS SILENTLY UNHOOKS A SLOW HOOK. Past `LowLevelHooksTimeout` the OS drops the offender
 *     without telling it, after which the hover pin simply stopped appearing until the overlay was
 *     re-locked — a feature that decayed rather than failed.
 *   * IT WAS PAID FOR ONE THING. The hook existed so a pinned window would receive mouse MOVES,
 *     because moves were the hover sensor that re-enabled capture over the pin.
 *
 * So the question is asked from the other side now. Main publishes the RECTANGLES a pinned overlay
 * still wants the mouse in (overlayHotZone.ts), the PRESENCE WORKER reads the cursor on its own
 * thread at ~32 ms and reports only the enter/leave edges, and `overlayHover.ts` flips this call
 * from the answer. Click-through is unchanged from the user's side; the app is simply no longer in
 * the mouse's path. `forward:` now appears in no `setIgnoreMouseEvents` call in this application,
 * and tests/overlayLockedSelector.test.mts pins that as source.
 *
 * WHAT LEFT WITH IT: the replay gate's mouse half (JOS-62's forwarding decision). Its whole job
 * was to drop the hook for the seconds a historical fold owned the message loop, and there is no
 * hook left to drop. The gate's OVERLAY HIDE/SHOW half is untouched and still the law.
 *
 * ...AND IT IS ALSO WHERE THE CURSOR WATCHDOG LIVES OR DIES (JOS-381). This function is the ONE
 * place an overlay's click-through state changes, so it is the only place that can know when a
 * locked window has taken the mouse — and therefore when the pointer leaving it might never be
 * observed from inside (the task-switcher case). `watchOverlayPointer` starts a watch on exactly
 * that transition and stops it on every path back; nothing about focus or z-order is touched by it.
 * See overlayPointerWatch.ts. It is the SAFETY NET under the hot-zone sensor rather than a
 * duplicate of it: the sensor knows a rectangle inside the window, this knows the window.

// THE ALT-TAB HIJACK, and it is Electron's documented Windows behavior rather than a mystery.
// `BrowserWindow.setFocusable` is spelled "changes whether the window can be focused" and carries
// the note "on macOS it does not remove the focus from the window" — i.e. on WINDOWS it does.
// `setFocusable(false)` deactivates the window, and Chromium's deactivate walks the Z-ORDER and
// calls `SetForegroundWindow` on the first VISIBLE window below it. An overlay of ours is
// always-on-top directly over the game, so the first window below it is EverQuest.
//
// That turned every auto-hide into a foreground grab, because `setOverlaysHidden` re-asserted the
// locked mode on the way DOWN as well as up, and the locked mode is `setFocusable(false)`:
//
//   "Alt tabbing from EQ will bring you back to EQ the first time but with hidden overlay… but if
//    you click into EQ, alt tab will continue to bring you back ANY TIME THE OVERLAYS ARE VISIBLE"
//                                            — report 01KZPTD3MHP3DFG7NJY5QF96VJ, v0.18.0
//
// The reporter's last clause is the diagnosis: Chromium's deactivate is a no-op on a window that
// is not visible, so the alt-tab that happened while the overlays were already hidden worked, and
// the next one — after they came back — did not. Alt-tab away, the debounce commits ~300 ms later,
// the hide pass re-states `setFocusable(false)` on five still-visible topmost windows, and the
// user is standing in EverQuest again wondering what they did wrong.
//
// THE FIX IS TO STOP RE-STATING IT. Focusability is a WINDOW STYLE (WS_EX_NOACTIVATE); it survives
// hide/show, so unlike always-on-top and the mouse mode it has nothing to re-assert. So:
//
//   * a window is BORN with the focusability its persisted lock implies, which costs no call at
//     all and takes the very first `setFocusable` — the one at `ready-to-show`, which used to fire
//     while another app was in front and could yank the foreground off it — out of existence too;
//   * and every later apply is a no-op unless the value actually CHANGED, which now happens only
//     when the user toggles the lock. There, moving the foreground is the point: locking hands the
//     game back, unlocking gives you the window you are about to drag.
//
// THE WINDOW ITSELF IS ASKED, never a remembered copy. `isFocusable()` is the exact state
// `setFocusable` writes, so there is no bookkeeping to seed at construction, none to clear when an
// overlay closes, and no way for a map to disagree with the window it describes.

// watches off, forwarding off. The window never leaves the compositor, so un-parking is ONE
// opacity flip — no stale frame, no SetWindowPos, no z-order churn, nothing for an eye to catch.
// `setOverlaysHidden` below still exists and still really hides: the replay gate and session
// teardown want windows GONE (the fold owns the message loop), and E2E never shows one at all.

 * survives hide/show, so there is nothing to re-assert — and re-asserting it anyway is what made
 * this function grab the foreground on every alt-tab. `applyOverlayLocked` still carries the whole
 * locked mode; its focus half is now a no-op unless the value really changed. See
 * `setOverlayFocusable`.
 *
 * E2E never shows a window (src/main/e2e.ts is the whole test mode), so a re-show is skipped
 * there; hiding stays live, since hiding an already-hidden window is a no-op. A historical replay
 * suppresses the re-show for the same seconds and by the same predicate — and

//

// stated at the top of that function: a window created somewhere else with its own idea of
// webPreferences is precisely the drift this file exists to prevent. Its preload is the third
// and leanest bridge (preload/cursor.ts — three receive-only methods).
//
// Three properties make it invisible to everything except the eye:
//   * `focusable:false` + `type:'toolbar'` + `skipTaskbar` — never takes focus, never appears in
//     Alt-Tab or the taskbar. A ring that could be focused would be a ring that could steal a
//     keystroke mid-fight.
//   * `setIgnoreMouseEvents(true)` — every click passes straight through to the game, and with no
//     `forward` and therefore no WH_MOUSE_LL hook. This window has nothing to click, so
//     pass-through is unconditional and permanent. It was the FIRST window here to refuse the hook
//     (it is the precedent JOS-62 and then JOS-370 both cite); since JOS-370 every window agrees.
//   * NO `-webkit-app-region` anywhere in its page — it is not draggable, and cannot become a
//     window the user accidentally picks up while playing.
//
// AND ONE PROPERTY THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SET: ITS ZOOM (JOS-154). The ring's CSS pixels
// have to be DIPs, because main sends it a DIP offset from this window's own origin to use as a
// CSS translation — so the app's text size (`uiScale`, JOS-123) must not reach it. It used to,
// and not through anything written here: `setZoomFactor` stores a zoom PER HOST, every page is
// served from one host in development, and the ring inherited the main window's (measured on
// Electron 43.2.0 — 1.0 to 1.25 on a main-window setZoomFactor). The pin is
// `webFrame.setZoomLevel(0)` in `src/preload/cursor.ts`, which is a per-view TEMPORARY zoom and
// therefore the only one that can hold this window still without moving the main window with it —
// the full argument, and the two alternatives that were measured and rejected, are in that file's
// header. Nothing to add to the BrowserWindow options below; the absence is the point.
