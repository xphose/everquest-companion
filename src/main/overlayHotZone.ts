// ============================================================================
// overlayHotZone.ts — WHICH PIXELS OF A PINNED OVERLAY STILL WANT THE MOUSE (JOS-370).
// ============================================================================
//
// A locked overlay is click-through. It is also not USELESS: it reveals a pin you can press to
// unlock it, the meters keep a working fight selector in their title bar (P3), and since JOS-138 a
// pinned list scrolls at its right edge. All three need real mouse events, and until this ticket
// the app bought them with `setIgnoreMouseEvents(true, {forward:true})` — a system-wide WH_MOUSE_LL
// hook owned by MAIN, which made every stall of ours a stall of the user's cursor and of in-game
// mouselook. The hook is gone. What replaces it is this: main names the rectangles that still want
// the mouse, the presence worker hit-tests the cursor against them off-thread, and the window's
// capture is flipped from the answer.
//
// SO THIS FILE IS THE ANSWER TO "WHICH RECTANGLES", and it is a plain function of a kind and a
// window rectangle — Electron-free, like `pointerWatch.ts` beside it, so the whole policy is a
// node test rather than something to alt-tab into and check by eye.
//
// ================================ THE FOUR ANSWERS, AND WHY ================================
// They are not a taste: each one mirrors the sensor that kind's renderer ALREADY runs, because the
// promise of this change is that nothing about the interaction moves — only its plumbing.
//
//   'chrome' — the METERS and the two timer-shaped panels with a header sensor (fight, overall,
//     heal-fight, heal-overall, xp, respawn). Their renderers capture on the HEADER ROW alone
//     (`capture('selector', …)` in OverlayHeader.tsx) precisely so a pinned meter's BARS stay
//     genuinely click-through, which is what pinning is for. Two rectangles: the header strip, and
//     the scroll grip along the right edge (overlayScale.tsx `SCROLL_GRIP_W`).
//   'header' — Adventure keeps only the header reachable. Unlock before searching, panning or
//     scrolling; its pinned body, including the right edge, belongs to the game.
//   'window' — the LIST kinds (events, buffs, debuffs). Their renderers hold capture over the
//     WHOLE window while hovered (`onEnter`/`onLeave` on the root), which overlayScale.tsx already
//     names as "the same trade taken at the other extreme". One rectangle: the window.
//   'none'   — the three STRIPS (toast, alertBanner, conCard). They have no hover sensor at all;
//     their capture comes from their QUEUE (cardQueue.ts `useQueueMouseCapture`) — a card is on
//     screen, or it is not — and they never forwarded either. Nothing to watch.
//
// ================================ THE ONE HONEST WIDENING ================================
// The GRIP band is watched whether or not the pane currently overflows, and the renderer's own
// `track` handler still asks the layout before it holds anything (overlayScale.tsx). So on a
// pinned meter with nothing to scroll, the right edge now takes the mouse for as long as the
// pointer is in it — where before it did not. That is a ~23 px strip on a window the user pinned,
// it is the strip a scrollbar would be drawn in, and it is the price of not knowing a layout result
// in the main process. It is stated here rather than engineered around because the alternative is a
// second geometry channel from the renderer, which is a whole transport for a strip of pixels.
//
// COORDINATES ARE THE WINDOW'S OWN (DIP), because `BrowserWindow.getBounds()` is. The conversion to
// the physical pixels the watcher speaks happens once, at the Electron boundary (overlayHover.ts).

/**
 * Is this overlay one the hit test should be running for RIGHT NOW? PURE, so "no zones and

 *
 * Every term is a state in which a hover would be wrong rather than merely wasted:
 *
 *   - `open`/`alive` — a window that is not there has no pixels to hover.
 *   - `locked` — an INTERACTIVE overlay owns the mouse outright and its renderer gets every real
 *     event the window manager delivers. There is nothing for main to hand it.
 *   - `visible` — hidden by the replay gate or by a session teardown: not on screen, not hoverable.
 *   - `parked` — on screen at opacity 0 (JOS-427). This is the one that would be a BUG rather than
 *     an inefficiency: capture handed to an invisible rectangle is a click-eater over whatever the
 *     user just alt-tabbed to, which is exactly the hard gate `setOverlayIgnoreMouse` already keeps.
 *
 * ==================== WHAT IS NOT A TERM, AND WAS FOR ONE RELEASE ====================
 * WHICH APPLICATION HOLDS THE FOREGROUND. `eqFocused` shipped here as a fifth term with JOS-370 and
 * the owner overturned it the day after (ruling, 2026-08-24): presence PREFERENCES are what mean
 * "hide when EQ is not open or not in the foreground"; EQ should not impact hover state otherwise.
 * The defect it caused is small and exact — a meter pinned over a browser stopped revealing its own
 * pin, because main published no rectangle for it, where the WH_MOUSE_LL hook this replaced had
 * forwarded moves from every app on the machine.
 *
 * THE COUPLING THAT REMAINS IS THE HONEST ONE, and it is why nothing has to be re-derived here: an
 * overlay the auto-hide preferences hid is PARKED (`presenceEffects.ts onPresence`, JOS-427's
 * opacity flip), and a parked overlay already publishes nothing by the term above. So a player who
 * asked for "take them off when I leave the game" still pays no hit test the moment they alt-tab,
 * and a player who did not ask for it keeps a pin they can reach. This predicate never reads a
 * preference and never reads presence; it reads what the window IS.
