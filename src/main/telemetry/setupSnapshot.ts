// ============================================================================
// telemetry/setupSnapshot.ts — THE PRODUCER the contract has been waiting for (JOS-364).
// ============================================================================
//
// `setupSnapshot` was declared in wave A1 with a full rollup, a TELEMETRY.md section and a
// deliberate note that its producer was unbuilt. Three waves of panels have since been built on
// top of a metric no client has ever emitted, and the fleet consequently cannot answer the
// simplest question anyone asks about a report — "what is this person's machine". This file is
// the missing half.
//
// ONE EVENT, ONCE PER SESSION, AFTER THE REPLAY. It is scheduled by `perf.ts` when the
// `replayDone` phase is marked, plus a short delay: the startup replay is the app's heaviest
// stretch of work, every reading here is a disk or a driver call, and a snapshot that stole
// milliseconds from the launch would corrupt the very startup numbers it sits beside. It also
// means the reading describes a settled app rather than one mid-boot.
//
// `recordEvent` IS THE GATE, exactly as it is for every other producer: the user's single switch
// is checked there, once, and an install with analytics off drops this on the floor with
// everything else. Nothing in this file consults the pref itself — a second opinion about the
// switch is how two answers to one question get born.
//
// NOTHING HERE THROWS AND NOTHING HERE IS REQUIRED. Every reading is wrapped: a store that
// refuses, a Logs directory that vanished, a GPU that will not answer inside the cap, an
// `eqclient.ini` an antivirus has locked — each degrades to `unknown` or to a default and the
// event still goes out with everything else it did learn. A snapshot is a diagnostic; losing one
// is not an app failure, and taking one must never become one.
//
// THE ARITHMETIC IS NOT HERE. `./setupFacts.ts` turns raw answers into buckets and enums, and it
// imports nothing but the contract so it can be unit-tested without an Electron process. What
// this file owns is asking — and every question it asks is answered by the OS, the driver, the
// screen or our own store. None of it comes from log content, and no path or device string
// survives the seam between the two files.

 * everything while collection is off; and the latch then guaranteed no second attempt. So a user
 * who launched opted out and turned telemetry ON afterwards contributed no machine-class row for
 * that session — which is the population the snapshot exists for, since somebody enabling
 * telemetry mid-session is very often doing it to report a problem.
