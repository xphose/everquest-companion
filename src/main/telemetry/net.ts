// telemetry/net.ts — the ONLY place usage analytics knows a hostname, and the ONLY place it
// can reach the network from.
//
// ============================ THIS BUILD IS LIT ============================
//
// `TELEMETRY_API_URL` names the deployed ingest route. Until this commit it was `''` and the
// dark-build law (`tests/telemetryNet.test.mts`) made "this build sends nothing" a structural
// fact; the owner has now approved collection, so the constant is filled in and the same test
// file pins the opposite property just as hard:
//
//   * the endpoint is EXACTLY this string, compiled in;
//   * the ONLY fetch in this directory targets that constant and nothing else;
//   * the consent gates below are unchanged — nothing transmits before the first-run notice
//     has rendered, and opting out drops the buffer AND the id.
//
// SECURITY.md, README.md and TELEMETRY.md were amended in this same commit, because the moment
// this constant became non-empty the "no telemetry of any kind" sentence stopped being true.
//
// There is NO user-configurable endpoint override and there must never be one, for exactly the
// reason feedback/net.ts spells out at length: an overridable ingest URL is an exfiltration
// primitive, not a convenience. Unlike feedback there is not even a loopback dev gate here —
// telemetry has no local-stack rehearsal need that justifies one, and a gate that does not
// exist cannot be widened. Nothing in settings, in the UI, in an env var or on disk can point
// this anywhere else; `tests/telemetryNet.test.mts` pins the absence of every such mechanism.
//
// The predicates below are the telemetry twins of `queueFlushEnabled` (feedback/net.ts) and
// live here for the same reason: they are PURE, they are the whole startup decision, and they
// must stay pinnable by a node test that loads no Electron.

 *                     that could reach the network behind a test's back. STILL TRUE with the
 *                     endpoint lit, and now it is the only reason the e2e run stays silent.
 *   * `endpoint`    — a build with no endpoint has nowhere to send; timers that can only no-op
 *                     are noise. (Kept as a parameter rather than folded into the constant so
 *                     the predicate stays pure and the truth table stays testable.)
 *   * `enabled`     — the user's switch. Off means off, immediately (the buffer and the id are
 *                     dropped too — collector.ts `setTelemetryEnabled`).
 *   * `noticeShown` — T1, AND THIS IS THE POINT OF THE WHOLE DESIGN: collection may buffer
 *                     before the first-run notice has rendered, but the NETWORK does not start
 *                     until it has. "Opt-out" never means "sent before you were told".
