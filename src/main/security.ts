// security.ts — the pure half of the Electron runtime's trust boundary.
//
// THE PROBLEM. Three of this app's windows-and-links behaviors take a string that ORIGINATES
// OUTSIDE the app and hand it to something powerful:
//
//   * `setWindowOpenHandler` → `shell.openExternal(url)`. openExternal hands the URL to the
//     OS. On Windows that means `file:///C:/…/evil.exe` LAUNCHES it, `ms-msdt:`/`search-ms:`/
//     `mailto:` and every other registered protocol handler is reachable, and a UNC path
//     (`file://attacker/share/x.lnk`) makes the machine authenticate to a remote SMB host.
//     The URLs that reach it are built from WIKI PAGE TITLES (`shared/wiki.ts`, fed by
//     `itemLookup`'s scraped `page` field and by the event feed) — i.e. text this app did not
//     author. That is the classic RCE-adjacent Electron hole, and "today's producer happens
//     to prefix https://eqlwiki.com/" is a convention, not a boundary.
//   * `will-navigate`. Nothing in this app should ever navigate a window away from its
//     bundled page; if something does, the app's own preload bridge (`window.eq`, full IPC
//     surface) would be exposed to whatever loaded.
//   * `sounds:getData`'s `packId`, which is `join()`ed onto the soundpack roots.
//
// THE SHAPE. Every rule here is a TOTAL, PURE function over arbitrary input, so it can be
// unit-tested without Electron (tests/security.test.mts) — the imageCache.ts / storeMigrations.ts
// precedent. The Electron wiring that CALLS them (`app.on('web-contents-created')`, the
// permission handlers) lives in windows.ts next to the window construction it guards, and is
// installed from the composition root (index.ts) before the first window exists.
//
// DENY BY DEFAULT is the rule in all three: an input that isn't recognized is rejected, never
// "passed through because it looked harmless".

 *                          predict, and the wiki is the whole point of the link.
 *   www.eqlwiki.com      — same site; the wiki answers on both.

 *                          imageCache.ts's IMAGE_URL_ALLOWLIST). Listed so a future boss link
 *                          works, not because one exists today.

 *                          including whatever a "download this fix" page would be. The app has
 *                          exactly ONE reason to send anybody there — its own project — and the
 *                          ONE link that uses it is a constant in the renderer bundle
 *                          (`GITHUB_RELEASES_URL`), not text this app did not author. So the

 *
