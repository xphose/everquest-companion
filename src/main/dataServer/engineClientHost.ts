// ============================================================================
// engineClientHost.ts — THE APP BECOMES A CLIENT OF ITS OWN ENGINE (JOS-479, phase 3).
// ============================================================================
//
// Three things existed before this file and none of them had ever met. `supervisor.ts` spawns the
// engine and proves it healthy (JOS-467). `shared/dataServer/client.ts` is the app's side of the
// protocol — epoch law, typed requests, subscriptions (JOS-468). `engined` serves `module.snapshot`
// off a real twenty-module fold (JOS-478). This is the wiring that joins them INSIDE THE RUNNING
// PRODUCT, and it is the moment owner ruling 20 names: the first real client testing against the
// server.
//
// WHAT IT DOES, in five sentences. When the supervisor says READY it takes the port and the token
// that launch minted, opens one loopback connection, hellos, and attaches the engine to THE SAME
// LOG THIS PROCESS IS TAILING. When the character changes — or any time the TypeScript world is
// rebuilt — it attaches again, because that is the same funnel and last-pick-wins is the ENGINE's
// law now (`session.attach` preempts, never queues). When the engine dies and is respawned it does
// all of that over: a respawn is a launch, the token and port are new, resume is re-query. When
// both worlds have landed on the same log it runs THE PARITY PROBE and writes one line to the dev
// log. And that line is the entire user-visible surface of this ticket.
//
// ── WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// No IPC, no `window.eq`, no renderer anything. No store write. No branch in the product reads
// anything the engine says. The TypeScript fold remains the app's only source of truth and will be
// until the cutover deletes it (plan, phase 3). The cost on a launch that asked for NO engine —
// `EQC_ENGINE=0`, which since JOS-495 is the only way to be in that state — is exactly one `if` in
// `engineHost.ts`: `installEngineClient` is never called, no observer is registered, and
// `pipeline.ts sendWorldRebuilt` finds a null.
//
// THAT IS STILL TRUE AFTER JOS-483, and it is worth saying because the engine now appears in the
// app's performance panel. This file grew two READS and one request (`lastParitySummary`,
// `enginePerfSnapshot`) and no channel: `src/main/perf.ts` calls them and pushes over the perf IPC
// that already existed, which is the same shape every other number in that panel has. Nothing here
// knows a window exists, and no PRODUCT branch reads the engine — a diagnostic is not a source of
// truth. The renderer still has no engine client; brokering one is JOS-484.
//
// ── WHY A FRESH CLIENT PER LAUNCH, RATHER THAN `client.attach` OVER A REPLACEMENT TRANSPORT ────
//
// `EngineClient` takes its token at construction and holds it for the life of the object, which is
// right: a token IS the identity of one connection to one launch. A respawn mints a NEW secret
// (contract rule 5), so a client that survived it would be an object holding credentials for a
// process that no longer exists. So a respawn builds a new client and closes the old one, and
// `client.attach` is used for what it is for — handing this client its transport, which is also the
// path a future reconnect-to-the-same-launch would take. Nothing is carried across, which is
// exactly the resume-is-requery law the client library already enforces on its own state.
//
// ── PREEMPTION, LOCALLY ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Everything below is asynchronous — a connect, an attach round trip, a fold that takes as long as
// the log is big, five snapshot round trips — and all of it can be superseded mid-flight by a
// character switch or an engine respawn. `switchController.ts`'s answer is the one used here: a
// GENERATION counter, re-asked after every suspension point. A turn that has lost touches nothing
// and, in particular, WRITES NO LINE — a parity verdict from a world somebody has since replaced
// would be a measurement of nothing, printed with authority.
