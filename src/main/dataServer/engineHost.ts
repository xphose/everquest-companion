// ============================================================================
// engineHost.ts — the composition root's half of the engine supervisor (JOS-467, phase 0).
// ============================================================================
//
// `supervisor.ts` is the state machine and imports nothing from Electron, Node's child process or
// Node's net. This file is everything that was left over when that was made true: which binary,
// which spawn, which socket, which clock, where a line goes. It is the same split
// `processPriority.ts` describes — mechanism there, policy and wiring here — and it is deliberately
// the only file in `src/main/dataServer` that anybody would have to rewrite to run the engine some
// other way.
//
// THE FLAG IS AN ESCAPE HATCH NOW, NOT A SWITCH (JOS-495, the owner's cutover ruling). `EQC_ENGINE=0`
// in the environment turns this OFF. Anything else turns it ON — and "anything else" is above all
// the UNSET variable that every ordinary launch has, in dev and in the packaged app alike. THE
// ENGINE IS THE PRODUCT; the flag is what you reach for when you need it gone.
//
// THAT IS THE EXACT INVERSION OF WHAT THIS HEADER USED TO ARGUE, and the old argument is not being
// quietly deleted — it was right for its phase and its phase is over. Default-off is how you carry
// a feature while you are still deciding about it, and the deciding is done: packaged builds have
// SHIPPED the binary since JOS-473, the whole e2e suite has run engine-on since JOS-490, the shim
// answers three of the app's own reads, the engine makes the sound, and the parity probe has been
// comparing the two folds on every rebuild for as long as any of it. A flag nobody sane leaves off
// is not a switch, it is a diagnostic.
//
// WHAT SURVIVES FROM THE OLD ARGUMENT IS THE SHAPE. It is still an environment variable rather than
// a store preference or a vite `define`, and for reasons the inversion does not touch:
//   * a STORE PREFERENCE would be a user-facing switch for the app's own architecture — nothing a
//     user can act on, and a support answer nobody should ever have to give;
//   * a VITE DEFINE would need the owner to restart `npm run dev` to change (AGENTS.md's rule), and
//     the whole point of an escape hatch is that a developer reaches for it in one shell;
//   * an env var read at boot is a FACT ABOUT HOW THE PROCESS WAS STARTED, so a diagnosis that
//     needs the engine gone gets it by starting the process differently rather than by editing one.
// `=1` still means on, and not as a compatibility special case — it is simply not `'0'`
// (`shared/dataServer/engineFlags.ts`, which owns the comparison for all five readers of it).
//
// THE E2E HARNESS IS NOT A SPECIAL CASE HERE, and that is still deliberate. `EQ_E2E` is not a gate
// on this file: the flags are a thing a developer sets in a shell, and since JOS-490 the harness is
// a developer who always sets them (`appWindow.mts ENGINE_ON`). That forcing became REDUNDANT with
// this ticket and is kept anyway — belt and braces across the default flip — while the one spec
// whose subject is the engine's ABSENCE opts out by name with `EQC_ENGINE=0`. The rule this repo
// actually keeps is that the test mode changes as little about the product as possible, and a
// harness that names what it wants changes nothing at all.
//
// TWO NARROWER FLAGS LIVE INSIDE THIS ONE and neither means anything without it: `EQC_ENGINE_SERVE`
// lets the engine answer the app's READS (serveShim.ts for the answers, serveDeltas.ts for the
// notification that there is a newer one), and `EQC_ENGINE_ALERTS` lets it make a SOUND
// (alertsAudio.ts). Both default ON beside this one and both are taken away the same way, by `=0`
// — which is what makes "is this the serve path or the audio path?" two launches rather than a
// build. They are read by their own files and reached only from inside the guard below, which is
// the same one-gate rule the client and the broker keep: this file decides whether there is an
// engine at all, and nothing else re-asks that question.
//
// AND SINCE JOS-479 THE FLAG BUYS ONE MORE THING: the app's own CLIENT. `engineClientHost.ts`
// connects to the launch this file supervises, attaches the engine to the log this process is
// tailing, and runs the parity probe. It is armed from inside the guard below and torn down beside
// the supervisor, so `EQC_ENGINE` remains the single switch for the whole feature — a second gate
// would be a second thing to forget.
//
// WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WITH NO BINARY — UNCHANGED BY THE FLIP, AND THAT IS THE POINT. The supervisor
// probes, finds nothing, logs one line naming what it looked for, and stops. No error-store entry,
// no retry storm, no crash. Absence is a CONDITION here, not a failure. Which of the two worlds a
// launch is therefore in is decided by the DISK and not by the flag, and the two answers are:
//   * A DEV CHECKOUT THAT HAS NOT RUN `cargo build` gets exactly the app it got before this ticket
//     — TypeScript fold, TypeScript reads, TypeScript alerts — because default-on asks for an
//     engine that is not there and gets the same silent nothing it always did. Nobody has to know
//     the default moved to keep working in this tree.
//   * A PACKAGED BUILD HAS THE BINARY, always, and has since JOS-473 (`extraResources` copies
//     `resources/engine/engined.exe` beside the asar, the first path `engineBinaryCandidates`
//     probes, and `build:engine` fails the build rather than shipping without it). So default-on in
//     a shipped app means the engine actually runs, which is the entire content of this ticket.

// WHY THIS EXISTS, IN ONE SENTENCE: Windows locks the image file of a running process, so an app
// that spawns `engine/target/debug/engined.exe` makes `cargo build -p engined` fail at the LINK
// step for as long as the app is up.
//
// THAT IS NOT A THEORETICAL TOLL. The owner's dev app runs all day by design (the ENGINE-BY-DEFAULT
// checkout), and every worker in this program builds the engine; before this, the two could not both
// be true, and the workaround was "close the app, build, reopen it" performed by hand, repeatedly,
// by whoever remembered. Copying the image once per launch removes the conflict at its cause: the
// process holds a lock on the COPY, and the path cargo writes to is never open.
//
// IT IS CHEAP AND IT IS BOUNDED. One `copyFileSync` of a file the OS has in its cache moments after
// a build, once per LAUNCH (not per request, not per attach) — tens of milliseconds for a debug
// build, and it happens on the supervisor's own path before any socket exists, so nothing waits on
// it. The directory is swept at every app start, so a checkout never accumulates images.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO:
//   * IT DOES NOT TOUCH THE PACKAGED LAUNCH. `isCargoTargetBinary` is the gate and it is spelled
//     against cargo's own output directories, so a shipped `resources/engine/engined.exe` is spawned
//     exactly as it was — the same bytes JOS-473 signed, from the same path, with the same cwd.
//     A staged copy of a signed binary would be a second file for the AV heuristics and the
//     signature checker to have opinions about, for no benefit at all: nothing overwrites it.
//   * IT DOES NOT COPY ANYTHING BESIDE THE EXECUTABLE. That is not an omission — it is the shipped
//     arrangement, restated: `extraResources` puts `engined.exe` alone under `resources/engine/`
//     and that build runs, so a lone image is known to resolve its imports. The `cwd` the spawn
//     gives it is the staging directory rather than the cargo one, which matches the packaged
//     launch's own `cwd` discipline (AGENTS.md's DLL-resolution law) rather than diverging from it.
//   * IT DOES NOT FAIL A LAUNCH. Every error here is a dev-log line and a fall-through to the
//     original path — the pre-JOS-496 behaviour — because a copy is an ergonomic convenience and an
//     app that refused to start its engine over one would have traded a build annoyance for an
//     outage.

/** Where the copies live. Under `userData` rather than the OS temp directory on purpose: the app

      // failed spawn and a wedged engine all end in an app that still plays its own alerts.

      // swap is complete before a frame can exist. That is the whole of what "must not be late"
      // needed, and it never needed to be this early.
      //
      // IT IS STILL A LAUNCH-SHAPED EDGE, and that matters for `alertsAudio.ts`'s own argument that
      // the verdict is taken ONCE rather than re-asked mid-session ("a gate that re-opened
      // mid-session would mean the app could start playing from the engine halfway through a
      // raid"). A respawn IS a launch (contract rule 5), so arming per launch keeps that property;
      // arming on, say, the engine's fold going live would not.
      //
      // THE RESIDUAL, NAMED: between READY and the engine's own fold going live, this process's
      // evaluator is silent and the engine's has not reached the tail. A live line in that window
      // fires in neither world — the engine meets it during its historical catch-up, where it is
      // not live and does not fire. That window is bounded by the fold and is STRICTLY SMALLER than
      // the one shipping today (which began at process start); closing it entirely means arming on
      // go-live, which trades this gap for the mid-session re-opening the file argues against. Left
      // as an owner call rather than decided here.
