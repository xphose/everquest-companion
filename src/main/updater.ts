// updater.ts — TRANSPARENT auto-update via electron-updater
// (Task #27; UX rework #55; the invisible-update rework is Task #60).
//
// GOAL (user's words): "transparent upgrades where you can click a button to
// restart to automatically use the new version. silent background download and
// install, transparently cleanly … they don't put the installer in your face
// over and over." That is the Discord / VS Code / Claude Code model, and on
// Windows it is achievable ONLY because of the installer shape we already ship
// (per-user one-click NSIS). See the research block below for why.
//
// SHAPE OF THE FLOW
//   1. Check on a lazy cadence (shared/update.ts: ~45s after launch, then every
//      4h +/- 25% jitter, exponential backoff on failure). Never a modal.
//   2. On `update-available` we start the download OURSELVES (autoDownload is
//      off — see "why autoDownload is off" below) into electron-updater's cache.
//   3. On `update-downloaded` the build is STAGED, not installed. The left-nav
//      chip lights up gold; a single 8s toast fires once. Nothing else happens.
//   4. Either the user clicks the chip -> `update:install` -> quitAndInstall,
//      or they never do and `autoInstallOnAppQuit` applies it silently the next
//      time they close the app. Both paths are UI-less.
//
// DEV GUARD: electron-updater throws ("app-update.yml not found") when the app
// is not packaged. We skip the machinery in that case (`npm run dev` stays
// quiet) but still answer the read/no-op IPCs so the UI renders identically.
//
// ===========================================================================
// RESEARCH (Task #60) — verified against the INSTALLED electron-updater@6.8.9
// and app-builder-lib sources in node_modules, not against the docs site. The
// published docs describe a newer API (`quitAndInstall(…, waitUntilNextLaunch)`,
// `autoInstallEvent`) that DOES NOT EXIST in 6.8.9
// (electron-updater/out/BaseUpdater.d.ts:9 declares only
// `quitAndInstall(isSilent?, isForceRunAfter?)`). Re-verify on upgrade.
//
// --- 1. Does an installer window EVER appear for us? -----------------------
// YES — but only on one code path, and we do not take it.
//
// electron-updater/out/NsisUpdater.js:101-149 builds the installer argv:
//     args = ["--updated"]
//     if (isSilent)        args.push("/S")
//     if (isForceRunAfter) args.push("--force-run")
//
// app-builder-lib/templates/nsis/installSection.nsh:14-33, inside `!ifdef
// ONE_CLICK` (which our `oneClick: true` defines — NsisTarget.js:380):
//     ${IfNot} ${Silent}
//       SpiderBanner::Show /MODERN /ICON …
//       SendMessage $0 ${WM_SETTEXT} 0 "STR:$(installing)"
//     ${endif}
// `${Silent}` is NSIS's own built-in, set by `/S`. So:
//
//   quitAndInstall()          -> `--updated --force-run`   VISIBLE installer
//                                (isSilent=false makes isForceRunAfter default
//                                to autoRunAppAfterInstall — BaseUpdater.js:13-27)
//   quitAndInstall(true,true) -> `--updated /S --force-run`  NO UI, relaunches
//   autoInstallOnAppQuit      -> `--updated /S`              NO UI, no relaunch
//                                (BaseUpdater.js:69-90, `this.install(true,false)`)
//
// => MITIGATION, and it is the whole ballgame: NEVER call bare quitAndInstall().
//    We call quitAndInstall(true, true). Both of our paths are UI-less.
//
// `--updated` is the second suppressor. allowOnlyOneInstallerInstance.nsh:50-79:
// if the app is still running, the installer shows a MessageBox — UNLESS
// ${isUpdated}, in which case it sleeps 1s and taskkills quietly. The process
// probe uses nsExec (windowless), so no console flash either.
// NOTE: the relaunched app receives `--updated` in process.argv
// (common.nsh:123-132) — our argv handling must tolerate it (it does; we read
// env, not flags).
//
// --- 2. Elevation: none, and structurally so ------------------------------
// `perMachine: false` means NsisTarget.js:412-419 never defines
// INSTALL_MODE_PER_ALL_USERS, so installer.nsi:19-21 compiles
// `RequestExecutionLevel user` — no UAC manifest exists in the exe at all.
// Separately NsisTarget.js:290-292 only writes `isAdminRightsRequired` into
// latest.yml `if (isPerMachine && …)`, so the flag is absent, DownloadedUpdate-
// Helper.js:61 records false, and NsisUpdater.js:126-130's elevate.exe branch is
// never taken. The ONLY residual elevation path is the spawn-failure fallback
// (NsisUpdater.js:131-147: UNKNOWN/EACCES -> elevate.exe -> UAC). This is why
// AGENTS.md says never flip perMachine — it would turn every update into a UAC
// prompt AND make oneClick installs elevate.
//
// --- 3. Staged vs installed ----------------------------------------------
// "Downloaded" means an exe is sitting in
// %LOCALAPPDATA%\<updaterCacheDirName>\pending\ next to update-info.json
// (AppUpdater.js:545-554 + AppAdapter.js:11-12; DownloadedUpdateHelper.js:30-65).
// The install dir is untouched until that exe is spawned. The staged file
// survives app restarts — which is what makes "ignore the chip forever" safe.
//
// --- 4. Differential/blockmap downloads ----------------------------------
// On by default; reuses blocks from %LOCALAPPDATA%\<cache>\installer.exe against
// the previous release's .blockmap (AppUpdater.js:643-712). Every failure mode
// (missing old release, size mismatch, blockmap version mismatch) is caught at
// AppUpdater.js:704-711 -> "fallback to full download". So a broken differential
// costs bandwidth, never correctness. GitHub forces one sequential Range request
// per op (GitHubProvider.js:14-17, "because GitHib uses S3").
//
// --- 5. GitHub feed cost + rate limiting ----------------------------------
// GitHubProvider deliberately AVOIDS api.github.com ("do not use API for GitHub
// to avoid limit" — GitHubProvider.js:158-175). One check = 3 plain github.com
// GETs: releases.atom, (only when allowPrerelease=false) releases/latest, and
// releases/download/<tag>/latest.yml. So the documented 60/hr unauthenticated
// API limit does not apply; undocumented abuse-detection limits do, which is
// exactly what the jittered multi-hour cadence is for. Asset downloads 302 to
// objects.githubusercontent.com and are CDN-cacheable (util.js:18-28 skips the
// no-cache query for GitHub).
//
// --- 6. The trap that bit the old code -----------------------------------
// (a) SETTING autoUpdater.channel SILENTLY FORCES allowDowngrade = true
//     (AppUpdater.js:44). We set `channel` on every launch, so downgrades were
//     enabled the whole time — a re-published/rolled-back release could have
//     walked an install BACKWARDS. `applyChannel` now resets it to false.
// (b) `update-downloaded` IS RE-EMITTED on every check that resolves to an
//     already-staged file (DownloadedUpdateHelper.js:33-52 -> BaseUpdater.js:
//     31-35 always calls dispatchUpdateDownloaded + addQuitHandler). Any UI that
//     fires on that event re-fires on every poll — that is precisely the
//     "installer in your face over and over" the user complained about. Ours is
//     state-driven, the toast dedupes per version, and we stop checking once
//     ready.
// (c) Re-validating a staged file RE-HASHES the whole installer (sha512,
//     DownloadedUpdateHelper.js:88-131) on every check. Another reason to stop
//     polling once ready, and to poll in hours not minutes.
// (d) checkForUpdatesAndNotify() pops a native OS toast (AppUpdater.js:286-313).
//     Never use it.
// (e) disableWebInstaller defaults to false and logs a nag on EVERY download
//     (NsisUpdater.js:44-46). We ship an NSIS target, so set it true.
// (f) A failed download retry calls removeFileIfAny -> emptyDir(pending)
//     (AppUpdater.js:609-616) — it DESTROYS a previously staged update. One more
//     reason the retry count is bounded rather than infinite.
//
// --- 7. What the "invisible" apps actually do ----------------------------
// Squirrel.Windows (Discord's lineage) makes the same two bets we do: per-user
// install under %LocalAppData% so there is no UAC, and apply-on-next-launch so
// the user never watches an installer. VS Code's cadence
// (abstractUpdateService.ts) is a first check 30s after startup then hourly;
// Chrome/Omaha wakes hourly and compares against a configured minimum period.
// Ours is deliberately lazier than all of them — see shared/update.ts.
// Failure modes they all share, and how we cover them: partial download (sha512
// + temp-file rename, then our bounded retry), version skew (our isStaleVersion
// guard + we never persist a 'ready' state across restarts), update loops (the
// bounded attempt counter; electron-updater's own quitAndInstallCalled latch is
// per-process and gives no cross-restart protection), rate limiting (jittered
// backoff).

 * allowPrerelease branch (out/providers/GitHubProvider.js getLatestVersion) resolves the
 * tag by SHAPE, not by channel file. With a custom channel set, `shouldFetchVersion`
 * (`!currentChannel || ['alpha','beta'].includes(currentChannel)`) is false, so the ONLY
 * acceptable feed entries are tags whose semver prerelease component equals the channel —
 * i.e. `vX.Y.Z-main.N`. The moment the per-push `-main.N` prereleases were purged and
 * releases became stable `vX.Y.Z` tags, every 'main'-channel install threw "No published
 * versions on GitHub": stable tags have NO prerelease component and can never match. The
 * main.yml bridge never helped — the channel FILE is fetched only after a tag resolves.
 * (Builds 0.1.1–0.1.4 shipped that dead loop; the v0.1.5-main.1 rescue prerelease is the

 * false, giving the provider its simplest, atomic-under-our-CI path: releases/latest →

  //   (b) the updated-away guard — never pull a build we already run.
  // Behaviour is otherwise identical: we call downloadUpdate() immediately, so
  // downloads are still fully automatic and silent.
  // WHERE THE LIBRARY'S OWN DIAGNOSTICS GO (JOS-295). Set before anything else can make it talk:
  // until now electron-updater logged its whole life — including a full stack for every error
  // event — to its default logger, which is `console`, which in a packaged app is a stdout nobody
  // reads. Assigned HERE rather than above the dev guard because that guard is what keeps the
