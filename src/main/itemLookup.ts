// itemLookup.ts — "what's this lore/quest item for" knowledge service (Task #53).
//
// Answers, for an item the player looted, whether it's a LORE item and which quests
// it's used in — the "you picked up a coin off the ground, what's it for" question.
// (Ground pickups don't log a line; this keys off the parsed `loot` family. See the
// acquisition-line sweep in the Task #53 notes — the loot family is the ONLY
// item-into-inventory line the log carries.)
//
// DESIGN (per AGENTS.md "Data sources & scrapers" + the Task #34 spell-DB precedent):
//   0. The process-pinned wiki catalog is primary: a validated saved generation, or the
//      bundled offline data when no compatible cache is available. Daily updates stage a
//      complete pack for the next launch. A catalog hit needs neither a cache lookup nor
//      a network request; per-item wiki fetches remain the fallback for missing records.
//   1. LOCAL-FIRST. The scraped Plane of Sky dataset (posky.json) already knows every
//      Sky class-Test quest item + its quests + giver. Check it BEFORE any network so
//      a known Sky rune/claw/etc. answers INSTANTLY and offline. Its associations are
//      merged with any the wiki adds (deduped) — including into a DB hit, because posky
//      carries per-item island/giver detail the item page never states.
//   2. WIKI lookup — now the FALLBACK (MediaWiki at eqlwiki.com, same API the scrapers use):
//      search → resolve the item page → parse its {{Itempage}} wikitext for the
//      LORE/QUEST flags (statsblock) + the |relatedquests bulleted link list +
//      |notes summary. Polite: a single serialized in-flight queue with a small
//      inter-request delay (mirrors scripts/sources/eqlegends.ts sleep(110)).
//   3. PERSISTENT CACHE in userData (versioned JSON). Negative results (no page) and
//      offline misses are cached too (offline with a short TTL so we retry soon;
//      real negatives for ~7 days). A cache hit never touches the network.
//
// The PURE classification (wikitext → ItemKnowledge fields) is `parseItemWikitext`,
// unit-tested in tests/itemLookup.test.mts against verbatim real wikitext.

// WHERE THE 8.6 MB ACTUALLY LIVES, MEASURED (JOS-371) — read this before trying to make the corpus
// lazy from here, because from here it cannot be made lazy at all.
//
// The numbers, taken on the committed file: `items.json` is 8.75 MB on disk, costs 41.8 ms to
// JSON.parse, and retains a ~20.4 MB object graph for the life of the process. Against a launch
// whose `dataLoaded` mark lands at ~529 ms and whose `replayDone` lands at ~730 ms, with main's heap
// at ~71 MB after the fold, that graph is a real 29% of the heap and the parse is a real 24% of the
// 177 ms between `storeLoaded` and `dataLoaded`.
//
// AND THE IMPORT BELOW IS NOT THE ONLY ONE. FIVE main-process modules ES-import this exact JSON
// module — this file, `ipc/characterSheet.ts`, `ipc/planner.ts`, `mobDropEra.ts` and
// `planner/wornFocusIndex.ts` — and electron-vite inlines it into the main bundle EXACTLY ONCE for
// all of them (three of those files say so in their own headers; the built `out/main/index.js` is
// 15.2 MB, of which this is 8.75). So deleting the import here would move nothing: the bundle would
// still carry the bytes and module evaluation would still parse them, for four other readers.
// Removing the corpus from main's heap is a FIVE-FILE change plus a packaging change (the file
// would have to ship as a resource and be read from disk, which is the exact trap AGENTS.md's
// toolchain note warns about), and it would still buy nothing while `heldClickySpells` below is
// called SYNCHRONOUSLY BEFORE THE SCAN REPLAY (session.ts `installClickies`, JOS-438's law: a
// clicky firing has to be called a click on the pass that folds it) — that call walks the whole
// corpus on every launch, so a lazily-loaded corpus would simply be loaded eagerly by it.
//
// WHAT WAS DONE HERE INSTEAD, because it is what this file actually owns: the three DERIVED indexes
// below are built on first use rather than at module evaluation. They are 2.4 ms + 0.3 ms + 3.7 ms
// and 0.47 + 0.07 + 1.49 MB — modest, but every millisecond of it was being charged to
// `DATA_READY_MS` for a service that nothing asks anything of until the app is live.
//
// WHO ASKS DURING A FOLD: NOBODY, and that is checked rather than assumed. `lookupItem` reaches
// main through exactly two paths — `ipc/knowledge.ts`'s handler (a renderer click) and the
// eventFeed module's `probeLoot`, which is unreachable from a historical event because
// `EventFeedModule.onEvent` returns at `if (!live) return` before it. pipeline.ts injects
// `lookupItem` into the modules and says the same thing at the injection site, and it is DRIVEN
// rather than argued: `tests/eventFeedWindows.test.mts` case (A) replays two committed fixtures at
// `live:false` through the real module with a recording lookup double and asserts the double was
// never called. So a lazy index here is first built by a LIVE loot line or a user's click, never by
// the replay — nothing about the fold becomes async, and nothing it used to see goes missing.
