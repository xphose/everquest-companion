// IPC: the EXALTATION PLANNER's door (docs/plans/exaltation-planner.md §4.1, §6).
//
// Two reads over the committed item corpus and one per-character read/write pair. Nothing here
// touches the network, and nothing rejects: the corpus is compiled into this bundle.
//
// LAZY + MEMOIZED. `items.json` is already an ES import in `itemLookup.ts` (electron-vite inlines
// it), so importing the same module here costs no extra bytes — but WALKING it does, so the index
// is built on the first call and kept for the life of the process. An install that never opens
// the Planner never pays for it; one that opens it twice pays once. Same shape as itemLookup's
// module-scope index, just deferred.
//
// The renderer is UNTRUSTED, here as everywhere: the search query must be a string, and a set
// list is re-validated field by field against the closed slot/socket/class allowlists
// (../planner/validate.ts) before a byte of it reaches the store.

 * to mean something narrower — and the narrow thing is exactly what `plannerInventory` above
 * declines to cache at all, because IT is one parse per ask and this is a parse plus a fold that
 * every keystroke in the Gear tab would otherwise re-run.
 *
 * SO THE CACHE KEY IS THE FILE, NOT A FLAG. `outputStatus` is one readdir + one stat (the
 * registry caches nothing, deliberately — see its header), and path + mtime identify the dump
 * completely: a rewrite moves the mtime, a character switch moves the path, and a deleted dump
 * moves both to null. Nothing has to remember to invalidate this, which is the failure mode an
 * explicit `invalidateOwnership()` called from the auto-load path would have been one refactor
 * away from at all times. The renderer re-asks on `inventory:autoReloaded`; that push is what
 * makes the answer TIMELY, and this key is what makes it CORRECT.
