// `registerIpc()` is called ONCE from the composition root, inside `app.whenReady()` and
// BEFORE the first window is created, so no renderer can ever invoke a channel that has not
// been registered yet.
//
// The domains are independent: `ipcMain.handle`/`.on` key off the channel name, so the order
// of the calls below carries no semantics (unlike module registration order, which is bus
// delivery order — see pipeline.ts). It is kept in the order the handlers were originally
// written purely so the surface reads the same way it always did.
//
// Every channel name lives in `src/shared/ipc.ts`; nothing here invents one.

// and `dataServer/conCardServe.ts` opens the window, so the TypeScript hook — which today calls
// synchronously into Electron from inside the fold — stands down. Composed HERE and passed as a
// predicate, for two reasons written out at `registerConCardIpc`: `conCard.ts` sits downstream of
// the serve receiver so an import would close a module cycle, and the question can only be answered
// honestly per `/con` rather than once at registration.
//
// THE COMPOUND GATE LOST ITS WEAKER HALF (JOS-499 item 9) AND KEPT THE ONE THAT MATTERED.
// `shimServing()` was two default-on env flags and answered `true` on every checkout with no
// engine binary at all — the misreading that shipped a silent card once (conCard.ts has the long
// version). `engineServeReadiness().ok` is a MEASUREMENT: a client exists, its connection is
// ready, both worlds are on the same log, and the fold has gone live. That is the question, and
// deleting the flag beside it leaves the gate strictly more honest rather than weaker.
