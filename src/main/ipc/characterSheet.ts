// IPC: the CHARACTER SHEET's door (JOS-45) — the armory grid, the gear sum, and the carry-all.
//
// IT WAS GATED, AND SINCE JOS-327 IT IS NOT. This handler used to be registered only when
// `UNRELEASED` said so (src/main/unreleased.ts) — dev builds, or an explicit `EQ_UNRELEASED=1` —
// because the surface had not passed the owner's review gate; in a packaged build the channel did
// not exist and `window.eq.characterSheet()` rejected with Electron's own "No handler registered".
// The owner released the tab (2026-08-13) as the gear area's last face, so the registration is
// unconditional now and the promise the gate protected is simply no longer being made. What did
// NOT change is the file boundary below, or the shape of the answer.
//
// It lives in its own file rather than in `character.ts` because that domain is the ACTIVE
// CHARACTER (log tail, EQ dir, progress). It stayed its own file after the gate came off because
// the reason had always been two reasons: a gate wants its own registration site, and a handler
// that inlines an 8.6 MB item corpus wants to be readable on its own.
//
// WHY MAIN DOES THE JOIN. `items.json` is 8.6 MB and already inlined in this bundle (itemLookup.ts
// owns the import; ipc/planner.ts imports the same module so it is inlined exactly once). Shipping
// the corpus to the renderer to sum twenty-two items would be absurd, so main reads the dump,
// looks each worn item up, sums the blocks and answers with one small object — the same division
// of labour `planner:inventory` already uses.
//
// NOT CACHED, for the same reason `planner:inventory` is not: the dump is a file the player
// rewrites mid-session on purpose, and a cache would hand the renderer the answer from before
// they typed the command. No dump ⇒ `null`, which is the instructions card, never an error.
