// Everything this file does is ORDERING. The pieces themselves live next door:
//
//   channel.ts     which `userData` dir this process gets (prod / dev / e2e) + the one-time
//                  state seed. FIRST import, always.
//   crashGuards.ts process-level uncaught-error capture. Second, so it covers every module
//                  body that follows.
//   pipeline.ts    the log-derived world: LogBus, module registry (+ REGISTRATION ORDER),
//                  combat engine, epoch detector, spell DB.
//   session.ts     the active character's lifetime: scan → live tail, heartbeat, inventory
//                  watch, EQ-dir changes.
//   windows.ts     every BrowserWindow (main + overlays) and the Electron-side trust boundary.
//   ipc/           the IPC surface, one module per domain.
//
// What remains here is the sequence those pieces must be assembled in, and the app lifecycle
// that drives it. FOUR orderings are load-bearing and are called out at their call sites:
// the first-import law, the epoch subscription being the LAST bus subscriber,
// `registerSchemesAsPrivileged` running at module scope (before `ready`), and graphics safe mode
// being applied at module scope for the same before-`ready` reason (graphics.ts).

// FIRST import on purpose: channel.ts picks this process's `userData` dir (prod / dev /
// e2e — Task #58) and runs the one-time state seed, before electron-store is constructed
// (module-level) further down this import list.

// FIRST STATEMENT OF THE BODY, and at module scope for a hard reason: Electron reads
// `disableHardwareAcceleration()` while it assembles the GPU process and ignores every call that
// arrives after `ready`. The imports above have already run, so the settings store is open and
// migrated by now (channel.ts → store.ts, the first-import law) and this can consult a PERSISTED
// switch at a point that precedes the app itself. `EQ_DISABLE_GPU=1` forces it for one launch
// without any UI, which is the case it exists for: you cannot open Preferences in a window you
// cannot see. All of the reasoning lives in graphics.ts.
applyGraphicsSafeMode()

// …and the flags this MACHINE needs, on the same before-`ready` law (JOS-352). `appendSwitch` is
// read while Electron assembles the GPU process and ignored afterwards, so it belongs in this
// statement and not in `whenReady`. On real Windows the list is EMPTY and this is a no-op; under a
// detected Wine prefix it is the two flags that let the app keep the GPU instead of white-screening
// on a software renderer Wine does not implement (shared/wineDetect.ts WINE_CHROMIUM_FLAGS).

// THE TWO DERIVED-EVENT SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE GONE (JOS-499), with the bus they rode.
//
// They were the composition root's own contribution to the fold: the EPOCH detector (a derived
// `epoch` event at the first at/after-launch line, which every character-scoped module reset on)
// and the OFFLINE-GAP detector (a derived `offlineGap` from each `sessionStart`, which is how a
// buff learns it was paused rather than expired). Both were added HERE rather than in the
// pipeline because they had to observe each event only AFTER the modules and the combat engine
// had folded it, and this file was the last subscriber.
//
// BOTH ARE ENGINE-SIDE NOW AND HAVE BEEN SINCE PHASE 2 — the golden oracle proves the epoch
// boundary and the offline-gap arithmetic slice by slice, which is a stronger statement than
// this file could ever make about them. What is genuinely lost is the LIVE-wipe re-hydrate that
// sat inside the epoch arm: deleting and recreating your character while the app is tailing is
// the one case the engine bumps its own epoch for, and its `moduleChanged` cursors carry the
// re-read without needing a special signal from here.


// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// DEV-ONLY: the feedback-triage IPC surface (src/main/triage/**).
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// This is the operator's window onto the feedback backlog — the same Aurora DSQL rows and S3
// slices `scripts/triage-feedback.mts` reads, over the same IAM door. It exists in the OWNER's
// dev app and nowhere else, and there are THREE independent reasons a shipped build cannot
// reach it:
//
//   1. THIS GATE, which is `OWNER_TOOLS` since JOS-72 (src/shared/ownerTools.ts) and no longer
//      "am I a dev build?". `app.isPackaged` is false in a dev run — but it is also false in a
//      SELF-COMPILED build from this public repo, which is how a stranger's macOS recompile
//      ended up with the owner's backlog tab in its nav drawer. So the predicate now also
//      requires `EQ_OWNER_TOOLS=1`, which no fresh checkout has; `E2E` still excludes the
//      headless harness, which builds production-shaped and must stay off the network. The
//      import is DYNAMIC, so a build without the opt-in never even evaluates the module.
//   2. THE DEPENDENCIES. That module reaches `pg` and `@aws-sdk/*` — devDependencies, which
//      electron-builder never packages. A build with this gate patched out still could not
//      resolve them. The property is structural, not a runtime check.
//   3. THE CREDENTIALS. Auth is an IAM token derived locally from the LAUNCHING SHELL's AWS
//      profile (AWS_PROFILE, default 'eqc'). There is no password to leak, and a shell without
//      the owner's credentials gets IAM denials on the first statement.
//
// Failure to load is logged and startup continues: a dev tool must never be able to take the
// app down. `closeDevTriage` is the teardown — a live DSQL socket would otherwise hold the
// process open, the same hang the CLI's `finally` exists for.

 *
 * THE HARD CASE STOPPED EXISTING IN JOS-182, which is worth recording rather than quietly
 * deleting: the watcher used to be a `powershell.exe` CHILD, Windows does not kill children with
 * their parent, and one missed teardown left a PowerShell loop polling user32 forever with nobody
 * reading the pipe. It carried a self-reap for exactly the kill -9 case no in-process handler can
 * cover. A thread cannot outlive its process, so both the hazard and its workaround are gone.
