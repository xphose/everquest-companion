// planner/eraDerive.ts — LAYER 3 OF THE ERA JOIN: the era an item never states, read off the way
// the corpus says you would GET it (JOS-333, then JOS-341).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT JOS-341 CHANGED, UP FRONT, because it invalidated two sentences this header used to open
// with ("layer 3 can only ever hide" and "no new scraping")
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// JOS-333 walked the ITEM corpus and nothing else, and it ended with a measured refusal: 824 era?
// rows point at 151 pages that are not items — armour-set hubs, quest indexes — and the corpus
// physically cannot hold them (it enumerates `embeddedin Template:Itempage`). The owner ruled that
// remainder unacceptable to show, `era?` was made to hide (73ad7ec9), and JOS-341 went and ASKED
// the wiki. `scripts/scrape-page-era.ts` puts those titles, plus every dropper mob the corpus and
// the mob catalog name, through eqlwiki's own `action=eqlmetadata` at DATA-BUILD time and commits
// the answer as `src/main/data/pageEra.json` (shape: `main/pageEraDb.ts`). Twenty-two live
// requests, warm cache zero, and nothing at runtime ever calls the wiki.
//
// That bought two edges and cost two simplifications:
//   * `page` POINTS BOTH WAYS. An armour-set page the wiki files under `Classic Era` is a positive
//     claim about its members, and while `era?` hides, refusing to read it is a decision to hide
//     gear the wiki says is right here. So a derivation now carries a `verdict`.
//   * `drop-mob` IS DEFINITIVE — the one edge in this file allowed to overrule a drop zone. See
//     its own block below for the argument and for the correction to the example that produced it.
//
// THE REPORT THIS EXISTS FOR. The owner photographed three gear rows the app chips `era?` whose
// wiki pages are visibly covered in red `OUT OF ERA` pills: Dwarven Breastplate (Enchanted Imbued),
// Silver Full Breastplate, Scaled Mystic Breastplate. JOS-328 had already swept the corpus for
// out-of-era markers on those pages and found none, and that sweep was CORRECT — the pills are not
// on the page, they are on its LINKS.
//
// THE MECHANISM, characterized live 2026-08-13 before a line of this was written (seven requests,
// each announced on the ticket first). The pill is not parser output, not a template and not a
// gadget: eqlwiki runs a custom skin whose ResourceLoader module `skins.EQLImmersive.eraFilter`
// walks every internal `a[href]` on a rendered page, maps each href to its target title, and asks a
// custom `action=eqlmetadata` endpoint for that target's `outOfEra`. Targets that come back true get
// `class="eql-era-out-link"`, and the pill is CSS on that class. Four modes cycle off the header
// clock button — Off, On (pill), Outline, and Hide, which removes whole table ROWS owning an
// out-of-era link. The module's documented fallback, for when the custom endpoint fails, is the
// specification in the open: `action=query&prop=categories` on the TARGET, matched against
// `mw.config.wgEQLEraOutKeys`. That config on a live page read
// `[kunark, velious, luclin, chardok, chardokrevamp, holevp, warrensfearhaterevamp, fearhaterevamp,
// epics, epicquests, unknown]` at `wgEQLEraConfigRevision` 156232 — the exact `out` set of
// `PAGE_ERA` in `shared/planner/era.ts`, at the exact `Template:PageEra` revid that file already
// cites. `eraBadge(tag) == 'out'` IS the wiki's predicate. We hold it for 7,560 committed pages,
// so the derivation is a graph walk over bytes we already ship and needed no new scraping.
//
// GROUND TRUTH, taken from that same endpoint the same day and quoted here because the three rows
// below are what anyone will check first:
//   Small Breastplate Mold          outOfEra TRUE   (our eraTag `Epics`)
//   Scaled Mystic Armor Quests      outOfEra TRUE   (a quest page, start zone East Cabilis)
//   Cultural Tradeskills: Human     outOfEra TRUE   (an armour-SET page, and see the refusal below)
//   Full Breastplate Mold           outOfEra false
//   Silver Full Breastplate         outOfEra false  (the ITEM is in era; its LINK is not)
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE RULE (owner rulings, 2026-08-13, twice, and the second one widened the first)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// ONE out-of-era edge is enough. The first cut of this ticket asked for the opposite — mark it out
// only when EVERY stated path is out — and the owner overturned it mid-build, verbatim: treat any
// reference to out-of-era as fairly definitive, because *these datasources lean the other way, they
// would carry out-of-era gear by accident, not mark in-era gear out*. The second note widened it to
// any piece: the awarding quest, the tradeskill parts, zone reworks, other classes' versions.
//
// IT SPEAKS ONLY INTO SILENCE — EXCEPT FOR ONE EDGE. A row whose own page states an era, or whose
// drop zones place it, keeps the layer 1-2 verdict it already had, and five of the six edges here
// are consulted only where that answer was `unknown`. The sixth, `drop-mob`, is marked
// `definitive` and outranks a zone, for the reason JOS-298 gave when the page's OWN out-of-era
// banner earned the same right: a revamp replaces a zone's contents without adding a zone, so the
// zone name is not evidence about this drop table and the wiki's per-mob verdict is.
//
// AND IT NO LONGER ONLY HIDES. The `page` edge can say IN as well as OUT, because a set page filed
// under `Classic Era` is a claim rather than an absence. Measured: 40 gear rows are visible today
// BECAUSE a page vouches for them, against 2,474 hidden by an out edge.
//
// THE OTHER HALF OF THE SECOND RULING IS NOT IMPLEMENTED, ON PURPOSE, and this is the record of
// why. The owner also leaned the opposite way: an item eqlwiki carries that does NOT exist in other
// versions of the game is probably definitively IN era, because EQL ships original items. That is a
// claim about CROSS-VERSION EXISTENCE, and this repo holds exactly one wiki. There is no in-corpus
// signal that separates "EQL invented this" from "nobody has written the P99 page yet" — the P99
// date filings JOS-328 refused are the standing proof that absence on one wiki means nothing — so
// implementing it would be guessing in the one direction that SHOWS a player content that is not
// there. Recorded as the owner's lean for a future heuristic with a real second source, not acted
// on now (law 1).
//
// ABSENCE IS STILL NOT EVIDENCE (law 1). An item with no recipe, no quest and no drop list gets no
// derivation — it stays `era?`. An edge whose target is not in the corpus gets no derivation. A
// quest we cannot find in the quest catalog gets none. The rule is "one edge we can READ says out",
// never "we could not find an in-era path".
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE SIX EDGES, strongest first, and what each one is worth
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Edges 5 (`page`) and 6 (`drop-mob`) are documented at their own functions below, because each
// carries an argument longer than a bullet: the in-era direction's refusal for one, and the right
// to overrule a zone for the other. The four JOS-333 shipped:
//
//  1. `component` — a `|playercrafted` INGREDIENT whose own page the wiki badges out of era. This
//     is the pill itself, on the exact link the owner's Dwarven Breastplate screenshot shows: the
//     recipe needs a Small Breastplate Mold, and that mold's page carries `{{Epics Era}}`, which the
//     register calls out. Bought components count — a mold you cannot buy on this server is a wall
//     whatever else the recipe asks for. 308 pages.
//  2. `yield` — the recipe's `|yieldItem` when it is a DIFFERENT page from this one and that page is
//     badged out. Rare, and kept because a combine whose product is out-of-era content is not a
//     combine this server runs. 0 pages in today's corpus; it costs nothing and it is the shape a
//     rescrape could produce.
//  3. `quest` — a related quest whose START ZONE is an expansion later than `CURRENT_ERA`. This is
//     the Scaled Mystic Breastplate case, and it is the one edge that is NOT the wiki's own pill: we
//     read `startZone` out of the committed quest catalog and put it through the same `zones.ts`
//     table layer 1 uses. It agrees with the wiki where we can check it (Scaled Mystic Armor Quests
//     starts in East Cabilis and `eqlmetadata` calls the page out of era), and the tooltip says
//     "starts in" rather than claiming a badge. 106 pages.
//     EVERY related quest counts, not only the ones that hand the item out. `role` is present only
//     on the quest-catalog uses, so filtering on it would silently drop the whole `|relatedquests`
//     family — which is precisely the family the owner's screenshot shows badged — and the widened
//     ruling makes any out-of-era reference sufficient anyway.
//     WHERE IT IS MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN THE WIKI, measured against `eqlmetadata` on four of the quest
//     pages this edge fires for: Scaled Mystic Armor Quests, Shaman Skull Quests and Warrior Pike
//     Quests all come back `outOfEra: true`, and Necromancer Skullcap Quests comes back FALSE while
//     we call it out (it starts in West Cabilis, a Kunark city). That is the honest cost of a zone
//     inference and it is worth paying in this direction: you cannot walk to West Cabilis on a
//     classic server, and the chip says "starts in West Cabilis" rather than claiming a badge. Six
//     gear rows ride on that one disagreement.
//  4. `component-zone` — an ingredient the wiki does NOT badge, which the recipe says you can ONLY
//     get by killing for it, and which drops in resolvable zones that are every one a later
//     expansion. High Quality Brute Hide (Dreadlands / Frontier Mountains / Warsliks Woods only),
//     Excellent Sabertooth Tiger Hide (Kunark plus Tower of Frozen Shadow). This is our zone table
//     rather than the wiki's badge, so it sorts LAST and its sentence says so. It reads the same
//     three witnesses the app uses for the item itself — the catalog's zones for that ingredient
//     UNION the ones its page names — because reading fewer witnesses could call an ingredient
//     unreachable that the catalog knows drops in Lower Guk. 49 pages, and see `droppedOnly` below
//     for the 27 it stopped claiming once the recipe's own `sources` were consulted.
//
// NOT AN EDGE, deliberately:
//   * `|recipes` (recipes this item is an INGREDIENT of) — that is what the item is FOR, not how you
//     get it. Walking it would mark a classic bone chip out of era for being usable in a Velious
//     combine, which is the opposite of the question.
//   * DROP ZONES. They are layer 1 and they already spoke: a row only reaches this file when NO zone
//     resolved, so there is nothing here for a drop zone to add.
//   * TRANSITIVE CLOSURE. The walk is ONE hop. An ingredient that is itself crafted is resolved by
//     its own page and its own zones, not by re-walking its recipe — the corpus's `Crafted` chains
//     run four deep in places, and a rule whose answer depends on how far you chose to walk is not a
//     rule anyone can check against a screenshot.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE OWNER EXAMPLES, all four, and what each one cost to answer
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//   Dwarven Breastplate (Enchanted Imbued) — `component`. Its recipe needs a Small Breastplate
//     Mold, whose page carries `{{Epics Era}}`. Answered by JOS-333 off committed bytes.
//   Scaled Mystic Breastplate — `quest`. `|relatedquests` names Scaled Mystic Armor Quests, which
//     the committed quest catalog starts in East Cabilis. Also JOS-333.
//   Silver Full Breastplate — `page`, and the reason JOS-341 exists. Its rendered page carries
//     exactly one pill and the link under it is `[[Cultural Tradeskills: Human]]`, an armour-SET
//     page: not an `{{Itempage}}`, so not in the item corpus, and `|notes` is stored markup-
//     STRIPPED so the row did not even carry the title. All seven of its recipe components are in
//     era and it has no quests, so no walk over items could have reached it. The fetch reached it.
//   Life's Guard — `drop-mob`, and the report needed correcting before it could be answered. It
//     was reported as an era? row whose dropper is badged; the committed record says its page
//     opens `{{Classic Era}}` and its one dropper sits under a `Plane of Hate` heading, so layers
//     1-2 called it IN ERA and the planner offered it as farmable AC 30 loot. The rest of the
//     report is exactly right, and that is the whole argument for `definitive`.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE CENSUS, re-measured 2026-08-13 after JOS-341, over the committed corpus (11,213 pages /
// 11,375 keys, the JOS-328 rebuild). A COUNT OF WHAT IS THERE, not a threshold — the sweeps assert
// floors (`tests/plannerEraCorpus.test.mts`, `tests/gearIndexEra.test.mts`).
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//   CORPUS PAGES with a derivation: 463 -> 3,221
//                                   drop-mob 2,365 · page 442 · component 308 · quest 102 ·
//                                   component-zone 4 · yield 0
//                                   (out-of-era 3,143 · in-era 78)
//   GEAR ROWS carrying one:         361 -> 2,532 — drop-mob 1,820 · page 378 · component 284 ·
//                                   quest 32; 2,474 out and 40 in.
//   GEAR ROWS, 6,814 both sides:    in-era 2,319 -> 2,343 · out-of-era 3,725 -> 4,034 ·
//                                   era? 770 -> 437.
//   Default era-filtered table:     3,089 -> 2,343 visible of 6,814; 437 rows are still hidden for
//                                   having no verdict at all, down from 770.
//
// TWO NUMBERS IN THAT TABLE NEED THEIR OWN SENTENCE, because they LOOK like regressions:
//   * `component-zone` fell 49 -> 4 and `quest` 106 -> 102. Not one verdict changed. Those pages
//     also satisfy the DEFINITIVE dropper edge, which outranks them in `BASIS_ORDER`, so the row
//     reports a different (stronger) reason for the same answer.
//   * The before column is this repo's own measurement of the JOS-333 tip and is two gear rows off
//     the figures recorded on that ticket (3,727 / 768). The derivation set reproduces exactly
//     (463: component 308 · quest 106 · component-zone 49), so the difference is in how the
//     gear-row verdicts were counted there, not in any rule.
//
// THE SHELF JOS-333 NAMED IS STILL THERE and still recognizable — racial CULTURAL SMITHING armour
// whose recipes call for a hammer, mold or gem the wiki badges out (Elven Smithy Hammer 77 rows,
// Teir`dal Smithy Hammer 44, Imbued Emerald 28, Brute Hide 24). What JOS-341 added on top is a
// second, larger shelf: the 622 rows whose `|notes` name one of the nine `Cultural Tradeskills:
// <Race>` set hubs, eight of which the endpoint badges out. The ninth, ERUDITE, comes back
// `outOfEra: false` with no era token at all, so its 14 rows move in NEITHER direction — pinned as
// a refusal in the sweep rather than smoothed toward the other eight.
//
// PURE and ELECTRON-FREE, the `effectIndex.ts` posture: value imports are RELATIVE, nothing reads a
// file, the ITEM corpus is handed in (main already inlines it once for itemLookup) and the three
// small committed tables this needs are imported here because they have no other caller to pass
// them in. `tests/eraDerive.test.mts` drives the rules on hand-written records,
// `tests/plannerEraCorpus.test.mts` sweeps the real committed bytes, and
// `tests/gearIndexEra.test.mts` asks the four owner examples through the shipped renderer path.

 *   drawn on the exact link the owner photographed — and the owner's any-edge ruling makes one
 *   sufficient.
 *   IN needs the page's OWN era token as well, because `outOfEra: false` is returned both for a
 *   page the wiki files under `Classic Era` and for a page nobody has ever classified. Reading the
 *   second as evidence would let a link to `[[Blacksmithing]]` argue a breastplate into the
 *   current-era view, which is guessing in the direction that shows a player content that is not
 *   there. So an in-era edge requires `eraBadge(token) === 'in'`: a page that made the claim.

/**
 * EDGE 6 — `drop-mob`: EVERY mob that drops this is one the wiki badges out of era. The owner's
 * Life's Guard addition, and the only DEFINITIVE edge (see `EraDerivation.definitive`).
 *
 * THE EXAMPLE, corrected by measuring it. Life's Guard was reported as an era? row whose dropper is
 * badged; its committed record says the page opens `{{Classic Era}}` and its one dropper sits under
 * a `Plane of Hate` heading, so layers 1-2 call it IN ERA and the planner offers it as farmable
 * AC 30 loot. The rest of the report is exactly right, and is the reason this edge outranks a zone:
 * the pill on that page sits on `[[Agent of Innoruuk]]`, a Plane of Hate REVAMP mob the wiki badges
 * out of era. A revamp replaces a zone's CONTENTS without adding a zone, so the zone heading says
 * nothing about whether this drop table runs on this server — which is JOS-298's argument, applied
 * one link further out than JOS-298 could reach.
 *
 * EVERY DROPPER, NOT ANY. This repo's doctrine for this exact evidence class is already written
 * down in `eraVerdictAt`: any reachable source keeps an item farmable, because a mob that spawns in
 * both Lower Guk and Kael Drakkel is still a Lower Guk camp. An any-dropper rule would flip 518
 * currently in-era rows; every-dropper flips 33, and those 33 are named uniques in revamped
 * content. The owner's any-edge ruling governs which KINDS of reference count, not whether one
 * reachable dropper stops being reachable.
 *
 * BOTH WITNESSES, page and catalog, for the same reason `component-zone` reads both: the renderer
 * folds the mob catalog in beside the page's own `|dropsfrom`, so an edge that read only one of
 * them could call an item unreachable that the catalog knows a Lower Guk froglok drops.
 *
 * ABSENCE BLOCKS IT (law 1). A dropper missing from the committed table was never asked about —
 * the fetch enumerates today's corpus, so a rescrape can add a mob before the next fetch runs —
 * and silence is not `false`. A page whose `|dropsfrom` names nobody has no edge at all.
