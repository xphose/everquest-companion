// WHICH FOCUS EFFECTS THIS CHARACTER HAS ON (JOS-452) — the main-side resolution behind
// `PlannerInventory.focus`.
//
// It is a THREE-WAY JOIN and nothing else, over sources this app already ships:
//
//   the dump      what is on your body and in your focus sockets
//                 (`shared/planner/inventorySlots.ts focusBearers` — read its header for why the
//                  socket INDEX is what says a socketed exaltation is a focus and not a proc)
//   items.json    that item's `Focus Effect:` line, which carries the effect NAME and nothing else
//   spells.json   that effect's own spell page, which carries the percentage and the level cap
//
// The last hop is the one that makes the whole feature cheap: a focus effect IS a spell page, so
// the magnitudes and the level ranges are already committed bytes. The join is the SAME exact,
// rank-preserving, case-folded name join `effectIndex.ts buildSpellFacts` documents — "Improved
// Healing III" must join "Improved Healing III" or miss, because an item's Effect line names the
// exact spell it carries.
//
// WHAT IT REFUSES, all of it law 1:
//   * an item the corpus has never heard of contributes nothing. That is not hypothetical — the
//     owner's most-announced focus item, `Djarn's Amethyst Ring` (19,291 firings in his log), is
//     MISSING from items.json entirely, so the app cannot say what it does and does not guess.
//   * an effect with no spell page contributes nothing (the Minion/Servant pet families, three bard
//     resonance rows).
//   * an effect whose page states a head this app does not apply contributes nothing —
//     `shared/wornFocus.ts FocusKind` names the seven that are read and not applied, and why.
//
// DEDUPED BY EFFECT NAME. Wearing Improved Damage II on an item AND in that item's own exaltation
// socket is one focus effect, not two: they do not stack (the log shows one announcement per cast),
// and `bestWornFocus` would pick between two identical records anyway. Keeping one keeps the spell
// card's "which item answered" a single honest name. The item on your BODY wins over the socketed
// copy, because that is the one a player will look for first.

//
// AND THIS FILE STAYS ELECTRON-FREE, which is why the session-aware, dump-memoized accessor lives
// next door in `wornFocusCurrent.ts` rather than here: the node runner drives the join below
// against the committed dump (`tests/wornFocus.test.mts`), and one `import { app }` three modules
// deep would take that away. Same split `shared/planner/inventorySlots.ts` already keeps.
