// planner/gearIndex.ts — the committed item corpus → the GEAR PLANNER's candidate index
// (JOS-283, phase 2; the row model and its design rule live in src/shared/planner/gear.ts).
//
// One row per EQUIPPABLE item — 6,884 of the corpus's 11,213 pages state a `Slot:`, plus the three
// the curated layer repairs (JOS-67) — carrying slots, classes, races, era, flags, effects, the
// weapon block and the NUMERIC BASE VECTOR the whole feature sorts and filters on.
//
// PURE and ELECTRON-FREE, exactly like `effectIndex.ts` beside it: value imports are RELATIVE,
// nothing here reads a file, the corpus is handed IN by the IPC handler (which already inlines it
// for itemLookup, so main pays for the 8.6 MB once), and `tests/gearIndex.test.mts` runs THIS
// builder over the REAL committed bytes.
//
// IT RE-STATES NOTHING. Slots, classes, sockets, extraction tiers, the haste lock, the focus family
// and the effect one-liner join are all the same calls the donor index makes — `slotsOf` and
// `COMMITTED_SPELL_FACTS` are exported from effectIndex.ts for exactly this reader. The dedupe is
// the donor index's too: a page contributes at most one row, `|itemname` alias keys are skipped by
// PAGE identity (196 of them), and where two pages describe one item the ITEM'S OWN PAGE wins.
//
// AND SINCE JOS-333 IT ALSO CARRIES LAYER 3 (`eraDerive.ts`, beside this file): the one stated
// acquisition edge that points at out-of-era content, computed ONCE for the whole file before the
// row walk and attached to the rows that have one (`eraDerived`). It is a BUILD-TIME answer on
// purpose — the walk crosses the corpus's recipe and quest graph, and the renderer's job is to read
// a field, not to re-derive it per row per keystroke. The build census counts it like every other
// reading (`eraDerivedRows`), so a rescrape that changes the shape of the answer is visible.
//
// WHAT IT ADDS is the reading of NUMBERS, and there the honesty rule is the census rather than the
// row: `statInteger` (shared/characterSheet.ts) is the parser, a `%` value is admitted for the one
// key that states one, and every value or key the vector does not take is COUNTED BY KEY in
// `GearBuildStats` — so a rescrape that spells a stat a new way turns the suite red instead of
// quietly dropping a column out of the gear table (law 1).
