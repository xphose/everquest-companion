// ============================================================================
// ghDownloads.ts — release download counts, fetched BESIDE the analytics readout.
// ============================================================================
//
// THE NUMBER THIS FETCHES IS NOT AN INSTALL COUNT. electron-updater re-downloads the installer
// asset for every install it updates, so `download_count` is dominated by the fleet updating
// itself (v0.5.0: 61 downloads within hours of publication, from a fleet nowhere near that
// size). Every label that renders these numbers says so, in the CLI and in the tab; the install
// truth is `analytics_install`, which the same readout already shows as "installs all-time".
//
// IT DOES NOT FLOW THROUGH `buildAnalytics`. That function is pure over three arrays of counter
// rows and stays that way — a network fetch inside it would make the whole readout untestable
// without a socket. This module is called in parallel with the database read and merged at the
// presentation edges (`ipc.ts` for the tab, `triageAnalytics.mts` for the digest).
//
// FAILURE IS SOFT, ALWAYS. GitHub is unauthenticated here (60 requests/hour per IP), so a spent
// rate limit is an ordinary Tuesday, not a bug. Nothing below throws: every outcome is either
// `available: true` or a `reason` string the renderer prints in place of the section. A dark
// github.com must never be able to fail a digest that is otherwise about a database.
//
// THE REDUCTION IS SEPARATE AND PURE (`toDownloadRows`), so `tests/ghDownloads.test.mts` can
// feed it a captured response shape and assert the per-tag arithmetic without a network.
