/**
 * CHANNEL ISOLATION (Task #58) — the FIRST module index.ts imports.
 *
 * Three builds of this app can be alive on one machine at the same time: the installed
 * release, the `npm run dev` watcher, and a headless `npm run test:e2e` run. They used to
 * share ONE `userData` dir (`%APPDATA%\eq-tools`), which meant they shared the store, the
 * learned message overlay, errors.log, the soundpacks dir — and, because Electron's
 * single-instance lock lives IN `userData`, they also fought over the lock: launching the
 * installed app while the dev app ran just focused the dev window.
 *
 * So `userData` is chosen here, per channel, BEFORE anything else runs (electron-store is
 * constructed at module scope, and `errorLogPath()`/soundpacks/caches all resolve through
 * `app.getPath('userData')` — nothing in the codebase hardcodes a path, so redirecting the
 * root redirects every consumer):
 *
 *   prod (app.isPackaged)  → %APPDATA%\everquest-companion
 *   dev  (!isPackaged)     → %APPDATA%\everquest-companion-dev
 *   e2e  (EQ_E2E=1)        → a throwaway temp dir (wiped per run by the harness)
 *
 * Distinct dirs ⇒ distinct single-instance locks (Chromium's ProcessSingleton keys its
 * lockfile + message window off the user-data dir), so dev and the installed app now run
 * side by side. Verified empirically: two Electron processes with different `userData`
 * both win `requestSingleInstanceLock()`; with the same dir the second one loses.
 *
 * ONE-TIME SEED (both non-e2e channels): the pre-rename dir `%APPDATA%\eq-tools` holds the
 * user's real state. The first launch on a channel whose dir does not exist yet COPIES an
 * allowlist of state out of it (never a move — the old dir is left untouched as a backup).
 * The allowlist is deliberate: Chromium's Cache/GPUCache/Local Storage/lockfile are
 * regenerable noise and a stale lockfile is actively harmful.
