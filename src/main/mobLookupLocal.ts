 * ships with the app, so caching either would immediately be stale (JOS-137 constraint 6).
 *
 * Reads by IDENTITY rather than by the one name the caller happened to hold (JOS-142). The
 * own-loot index files a drop under the corpse's LOG name and the boss card asks with the ROSTER
 * name; `id.keys` is the roster's own statement that those are one creature, so the union is
 * evidence rather than a guess. What comes back is still `dropsSeen` — YOUR observations — and
 * the mob page keeps showing anything the wiki page does not list under its own separate "Also
 * looted by you" heading, so alias-gathered loot is never dressed up as documented drops
 * (JOS-137 constraint 7).
 *
 * LIVES HERE, not in mobLookup.ts, so the node test runner can drive the real merge: mobLookup
 * imports electron's `app` for the userData cache path and cannot be loaded under tsx, and an
 * untestable merge is exactly where the JOS-137 defect sat unseen (the suggestions.ts precedent).
 * `loot` is passed in for the same reason — production hands it mobLookup's shared singleton.
