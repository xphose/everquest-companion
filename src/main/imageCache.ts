// imageCache.ts — PERMANENT on-disk cache for every image the app downloads.
//
// THE PROBLEM. The app downloads two classes of image: EQ item icons (eqlwiki, keyed by a
// numeric file id) and raid-boss portraits (`bosses.json` carries 29 absolute
// wiki.project1999.com URLs). Both used to be `<img src="https://…">`, so every hover
// tooltip, every loot dialog, every overlay window and every visit to the Raid Targets tab
// re-asked a volunteer-run wiki. Chromium's HTTP cache is ephemeral (it is evicted, it lives
// inside the channel's Chromium profile, and it is not shared between renderer processes in
// any way the user can rely on), and the wikis answer through redirects that are not
// aggressively cacheable. Net effect: the same handful of KB fetched over and over, forever,
// against hosts we have promised to be polite to (AGENTS.md "Scraper etiquette (LAW)").
//
// THE SHAPE. A custom protocol handled in MAIN, backed by a plain directory. TWO routes,
// one handler, one cache:
//
//     <img src="eqimg://item/1234">                    an eqlwiki item icon, by file id
//     <img src="eqimg://url/https%3A%2F%2Fwiki…png">   any allowlisted absolute image URL
//        └► protocol.handle('eqimg')     main process, ONE handler for every window
//             ├► <userData>/image-cache/<name> exists ⇒ serve the bytes, no network
//             └► else fetch upstream once (polite UA), write ATOMICALLY, then serve
//
// WHY A PROTOCOL and not an IPC "give me a data URL" call: `<img src>` is the natural idiom,
// it needs no async plumbing in the renderer, and the SAME handler serves the main window
// and every overlay window for free — they all use the default session. (Verified: nothing
// in src/main constructs a window with a custom `partition`/`session`, so `protocol.handle`
// on the default session covers all of them.)
//
// WHY THE `url` ROUTE EXISTS AT ALL rather than a second id-keyed route: boss portraits are
// SCRAPED DATA. `bosses.json` holds the real upstream URLs (that is what the scraper found
// and what a human re-checks against the wiki), and inventing an app-private id for each one
// would mean a lookup table that has to be regenerated whenever the scrape changes. The
// WRAPPING is the app's concern, so the renderer wraps at render time
// (`lib/imageUrl.ts cachedImageUrl`) and the data file stays honest.
//
// PERMANENT means permanent. No TTL, no eviction, no size cap. A wiki file URL maps to one
// immutable image; anything fetched once must never be fetched again. Two rules keep that
// safe:
//   * ATOMIC WRITES. Bytes land in `<name>.<pid>.<rand>.tmp` and are renamed into place.
//     A half-written PNG cached forever is exactly the failure "permanent" must not create
//     (a torn file has no expiry to save it), and rename is atomic within a directory.
//   * NEVER CACHE A NEGATIVE *ON DISK*. A 404/offline/timeout writes nothing, so nothing
//     permanent can be wrong. Permanence is for successes only. (A negative IS now remembered
//     for the session, in memory — see "REMEMBERING A NO" below. That is a different promise:
//     it expires when the process does.)
//
// SINCE JOS-198 THE FETCH IS THE FALLBACK, NOT THE PATH. The app now SHIPS the wiki art —
// 751 item icons and 29 boss portraits, ~3 MB, named by this file's own `cacheFileName()` —
// and `bundledImages.ts` is probed FIRST. A normal install therefore never fetches an image
// at all, and everything below is what happens for the ones the bundle misses: an icon whose
// id landed in items.json after the last `npm run fetch:images`, or a source build that never
// ran it. Bundled BEFORE the userData cache on purpose — the shipped bytes are the ones the
// manifest can account for, so a fresh install and an upgraded one serve the same pixels.
//
// SECURITY. `parseEqImgUrl` is the ONLY thing that turns a renderer string into a filesystem
// path, and for the `url` route it is also the only thing that decides what the app is
// allowed to FETCH — a renderer-supplied URL is attacker-shaped input the moment any wiki
// text or scraped field reaches it. Two independent boundaries:
//   * WHAT WE FETCH: `normalizeUpstreamImageUrl` decodes the segment, parses it with
//     `new URL()`, and demands `protocol === 'https:'`, no credentials, the default port,
//     and a hostname that EXACTLY equals an entry of `IMAGE_URL_ALLOWLIST`. Exact equality,
//     never `includes`/`endsWith`: `wiki.project1999.com.evil.com` and
//     `evil.com/?x=wiki.project1999.com` both have to fail, and they do. Everything else
//     404s having touched the network zero times.
//   * WHAT WE NAME: the file name is DERIVED, never taken. `item` ids are digits-only and
//     length-capped; a `url` entry is named by the sha256 of its normalized URL, so no
//     amount of `../`, drive letters, UNC prefixes, NTFS reserved names or 300-char paths
//     in the input can name a file we didn't choose.
//
// TESTABILITY. Everything pure (URL parse, allowlist, path derivation, image sniffing) is
// exported and unit-tested in tests/imageCache.test.mts; Electron is INJECTED (the caller
// passes `protocol` and the userData dir), so the tests need no Electron and never skip —
// the storeMigrations.ts / overlayLayout.ts precedent.

 *                            URL strips a redundant `:443`, so an explicit default is fine.

// ---- A CACHE READ THAT FAILS HEALS ITSELF (JOS-266) --------------------------------------
//
// THE READING. `image cache: could not read <path>` arrived as a new error family: ~290 occurrences
// across 0.20–0.23, the largest fingerprint 8f0e7721ddcad03b at 198 on one build, and the exemplar
// says `code=ENOENT`. That is a file `existsSync` had just said was there and `readFile` could not
// open a moment later — antivirus quarantining the folder, a cleaner emptying it, a permissions
// change mid-session. It is not a shape this app can be wrong about; it is the disk moving.
//
// SO IT IS A MISS, AND A MISS IS SOMETHING THIS FILE ALREADY KNOWS HOW TO ANSWER. Two changes,
// which are one decision:
//   * EVICT AND RE-FETCH. The entry is unlinked (userData only — the bundle owns its bytes and a
//     deletion there would not restore them) and `serveFromDisk` returns null, so the request
//     falls through to the same fetch a never-cached image takes. The user sees the picture a beat
//     late instead of a gap. Deleting is what makes "as if it were never cached" TRUE rather than
//     approximately true: the fetch below writes a whole new file over a name nothing is holding.
//     A file that cannot be read often cannot be deleted either, and that failure is swallowed on
//     purpose — the re-fetch is what heals the request, the unlink is what tidies the directory.
//   * WARN, DO NOT FILE. `onError` in the composition root is `logError`, so every one of those
//     290 spent a line of errors.log and a `mainErrorLogLines` tick for a condition that ends with
//     the user seeing the image. It is now a counter (`imageCacheReadFailures`) plus ONE warn line
//     per failure CODE per session — console only, never errors.log, never the wire.
//
// PER CODE rather than per path or per session: ENOENT (the file vanished), EPERM/EACCES (something
// is holding or forbidding it) and EISDIR (something else is living under that name) are three
// different stories about the machine, and the second copy of any one of them says nothing the
// first did not. Per PATH would be the flood the ticket removed — one wiki image per icon on screen.
//
// IT CANNOT SPIN. One request reads each candidate at most once, evicts at most once and fetches at
// most once; nothing here retries, and a re-fetch that also fails takes the fetch failure path it
// always did (a counter for the network leg, an error for a host that answered, and — since
// JOS-198 — a remembered no that stops the renderer re-asking).

/** Node's own error codes for a failed read: uppercase and underscores, nothing else. Anything
