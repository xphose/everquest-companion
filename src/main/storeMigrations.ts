// Persisted-settings schema migrations — "an upgrade must be clean, going back indefinitely".
//
// THE PROBLEM. `<userData>/everquest-companion-progress.json` is written by whatever build
// the user happened to be running. Builds go back to the very first commit and forward
// forever; auto-update means a user can jump many versions in one step (and the pre-rename
// `eq-tools` store is copied into this channel verbatim — see channel.ts `seedFromLegacy`,
// which runs BEFORE any of this). Every one of those files must load cleanly in the build
// running today. Before this module the app only had ad-hoc, per-reader fixups (a flat
// `overlay` folded on read, an `alertSoundMigration` stamp) — and at least one shape change
// shipped with NO fixup at all: `progress` → `byCharacter` (commit 41831cc) silently
// orphaned every pre-character store.
//
// THE SHAPE. An explicit integer `schemaVersion` INSIDE the file plus an ordered chain of
// migrations, applied once at startup before anything reads the store.
//
//   * Integer, not app semver. CI stamps versions from tags and dev runs unstamped, so
//     semver-keyed migrations (electron-store's built-in `migrations` option) fire in
//     surprising orders across channels. An ordered integer chain is deterministic: the
//     file says where it is, the code says where it must get to, the steps between are the
//     only thing that runs.
//   * Absent version ⇒ 1. That covers every store ever written before this framework, so
//     the chain starts from a single, well-defined floor.
//   * PURE runner over plain objects (`migrateStoreData`), file I/O separated
//     (`migrateStoreFile`, now in ./storeFile.ts) — the src/shared/update.ts precedent. Tests
//     need no Electron.
//
// THE CONTRACT (this is what makes "indefinitely" real, and it lives in AGENTS.md too):
// any commit that changes a persisted shape ships a migration in the SAME commit. Never
// mutate what an old key means without a step that rewrites it.
//
// FAILURE POLICY, AND WHERE IT LIVES. Startup never dies over the store. The pure chain below
// answers for the DATA (a step that throws keeps what the earlier steps produced, stamps the last
// version that fully succeeded, and retries next launch; a store from a newer build is never
// rewritten — see the downgrade note on `migrateStoreData`). Everything about the FILE — reading
// it, quarantining an unparseable one, SALVAGING it before accepting defaults, the pristine
// per-version backup, and the atomic write-back — moved to `./storeFile.ts` in JOS-272, which was
// the only way to add a recovery path to a module already sitting at the 400-code-line ceiling.
// That file's header carries the whole of the failure policy it owns.

// The ONE dependency this module takes, and a deliberate exception to the note below about
// LAUNCH_MS: shared/speechText.ts is a pure content module (it imports one rank helper and
// nothing else — no Electron, no parser, no LogEvent union), and duplicating the speech mode

// Owner, 2026-08-04: "duplicative settings; you should not have to enable voice in Preferences."
// `VoicePrefs.enabled` is gone from the model, the UI and every runtime gate — an alert whose
// `audio` says 'speech'/'both' now speaks, full stop. Which voice, how fast, how loud all stay:
// they are the voice's CONFIGURATION, never its permission.
//
// THIS STEP EXISTS SO THAT SIMPLIFYING A SETTING CANNOT CHANGE WHAT A USER HEARS. That is the
// whole of it, and it cuts one way only:
//
//   * The switch was ON  → nothing happens to the alerts. They spoke yesterday; they speak today.
//   * The switch was OFF → every alert def with `audio:'speech'` or `audio:'both'` is rewritten to
//     'sound'. Those alerts were ALREADY playing their pack sound (the retired gate degraded them
//     to it — never to silence), so this preserves exactly what the user was hearing. Leaving them
//     alone would have been the loud failure mode: a user who muted voice globally chose quiet,
//     and an update that made every one of their alerts start talking would be the app overruling
//     a decision it had just deleted the control for.
//
// ABSENT / MALFORMED COUNTS AS OFF, and that is not a guess: `enabled` was written by
// `normalizeVoicePrefs`, whose rule was `raw.enabled === true` — anything else already behaved as
// off, for years, in the only code that ever read it. So the test here is the same test.
//
// 'speech'/'both' → 'sound' is expressed by DELETING the key: absent `audio` means 'sound' by
// construction (shared/alertTypes.ts), it is the shape every pre-voice def has, and it is what
// keeps the share-string fingerprint of a rewritten def identical to a never-spoke one.
//
// THE `speech` BLOCK IS KEPT. It is inert on a sound-only def (no reader consults it unless the
// def speaks), and it is the user's own configuration — the phrase they typed, the voice they
// chose. Deleting it would turn a behavior-preserving migration into data loss, and re-picking

// Owner, 2026-08-05: "it should be on by default." The toast overlay shipped the day before with

// meters. A meter is a window you open when you want numbers; the toast is invisible and
// click-through except for the few seconds a card is on screen. Off by default meant a
// celebration feature nobody would ever see. The default is now `true` (store.ts).
//
// WHY A STORED `false` IS FLIPPED, and why that is honest rather than presumptuous. A default is
// only the value for an ABSENT key, so flipping it would leave every store written since
// yesterday stuck at off — and `overlays.toast.open` is written on the FIRST launch of any build
// that touches the overlay config, not only when a user reaches for the switch. The feature is
// hours old: no stored `false` in existence is a person's decision to decline it, they are all
// yesterday's default written down. So this step rewrites exactly that value, once.
//
// WHAT IT WILL NEVER DO AGAIN. This is a one-time correction of a default, not a policy that the
// app may re-enable things. It is pinned to this one version step: a user who turns the toast off
// tomorrow writes `false` into a v9 store, this step never runs against it, and the switch stays
// where they put it. (`open` is also the toast's ONLY enable — the design's `enabled` IS the
// window's open-state, so there is nothing else here to correct.)
//
// The same commit stops READING `overlays.toast.sound` / `.volume` (the sound picker is gone —

// ------------------------------- 10 → 11: the graphics switches gain an `auto` state (JOS-31)
//
// A Wine user reported the celebration overlay becoming a stuck black box after a level-up
// (01KZGQZJ2HMZGRY28A7CVRG4QT, v0.7.0), which is the JOS-40 family arriving through Wine's
// compositor rather than through a driver. The fix is that the app DETECTS the prefix and takes
// the compatibility path by itself — and a two-state switch cannot express that, because it has
// no way to say "the user refused". So each switch becomes 'auto' | 'on' | 'off'
// (shared/graphicsPrefs.ts) and this step decides what each stored boolean MEANT.
//
// `false` BECOMES 'auto', AND THAT IS THE ONE JUDGEMENT IN THIS FILE WORTH ARGUING ABOUT. It is
// the same argument the 8 → 9 step made about the toast: `graphics` was WRITTEN ON EVERY LAUNCH
// that ran the 9 → 10 step, not when somebody reached for a switch, so a stored `false` is
// overwhelmingly yesterday's default written down rather than a person declining anything. Reading
// all of them as an explicit refusal would mean every Wine install that ever ran a v10 build is
// permanently excluded from the fix this ticket exists to deliver — a fix they cannot discover,
// because the symptom is that they cannot see the window that holds the switch.
//
// `true` STAYS 'on'. Nothing but a deliberate act ever wrote it, and detection must never be able
// to take a switch away from somebody who asked for it. That asymmetry is the whole step: the
// value that could only be a choice is preserved as a choice, and the value that was equally a
// choice and a default is handed to the thing that can tell them apart at runtime.
//
// WHAT THIS WILL NEVER DO AGAIN, in the 8 → 9 step's words: it is a one-time reinterpretation of a
// shape, pinned to this one version step. A user who turns a switch off tomorrow writes 'off' into
// a v11 store, and no future step gets to decide that they did not mean it.

// ------------------------------- 11 → 12: the companion yields the CPU to the game (JOS-366)
//
// ONE new top-level blob, holding one boolean:
//
//   `processPriority` {yieldToGame:true}
//
// ON IS THE POLICY, and it is the opposite call from the two blobs above it — which is worth
// stating plainly, because "a new switch ships off" is otherwise the house rule. `perfHud` and
// `graphics` are INSTRUMENTS and WORKAROUNDS: a HUD is something you reach for, a software
// renderer is a fix for a driver most machines do not have, and shipping either one on would be
// charging everybody for a minority's need. This is neither. Below-normal priority is a statement
// about what this app IS relative to the game it sits beside — it is never the foreground
// experience, and nothing it does is latency-critical — so the honest default is the one the
// player would pick if they knew the question existed. The people it helps most are precisely the
// ones who will never open Preferences → Performance.
//
// EXISTING INSTALLS GET `true` TOO, deliberately: an absent key normalizes to the default, so
// this step writes `true` into every store that predates the feature. That is not overruling
// anybody — nobody has ever expressed a preference here, because there was no control to express
// it with. The moment there is one, a stored `false` is a decision, and no future step gets to
// reinterpret it (the 8 → 9 step's promise, kept).

// ------------------------------- 12 → 13: the exclusive-fullscreen note's memory (JOS-375)
//
// ONE key deleted: `eqExclusiveNoticeDismissedVersion`, the app version at which an install
// dismissed the JOS-368 Preferences note about EverQuest running in exclusive fullscreen.
//
// THE NOTE WAS WRONG, NOT MERELY UNWANTED. It told a player their game was in an EXCLUSIVE
// display mode — the one an always-on-top overlay cannot share — on the strength of
// `Fullscreen=1` in `eqclient.ini`. On the current client that setting is a BORDERLESS
// fullscreen WINDOW, which shares the screen with an overlay perfectly well, so the sentence
// could never be true for anybody it was shown to. It was removed rather than reworded, and its
// memory has nothing left to remember.
//
// A STEP RATHER THAN A TOLERATED ORPHAN, which is this file's standing answer for a key whose
// reader is gone (1 → 2's `liveLoot`, verbatim): a dead key left in the file is a thing a future
// reader has to look up before they can rule it out, and the whole point of a versioned chain is
// that the file on disk matches the shape the code believes in. `delete` on a key that is not
// there is a no-op, so this is a no-op for every install that never dismissed the note — which,
// since JOS-368 shipped in no release at all, is every install outside the dev cohort.

// ------------------------------- 13 → 14: which casters teach the resist profiles (JOS-385)
//
// ONE new top-level blob, holding one boolean:
//
//   `resists` {includeNpcCasters:true}
//
// ON IS THE POLICY, and it was MEASURED rather than assumed — which is the whole reason this
// switch exists at all. JOS-382 refused NPC-on-NPC evidence outright; the owner's worry when he
// reopened it was specific and testable (a player's fire spells get resisted where a charmed pet's
// do not, because pets are tuned differently, so folding pet casts in would quietly drag a mob's
// fire number down). The `--compare` mode of scripts/gen-resist-baseline.ts put both populations
// through the same estimator on the owner's log, and the skew the worry describes is not there.
// So the family ships on, and the switch stays because the answer is the kind that can change.
//
// EXISTING INSTALLS GET `true` TOO, deliberately, and for the 11 → 12 step's reason verbatim: an
// absent key normalizes to the default anyway, nobody has ever expressed a preference here because
// there was no control to express it with, and after this step a stored `false` is a decision that
// no future step gets to reinterpret.
//
// NOTHING ABOUT THE LEDGER MOVES. The switch is read when a card is DRAWN, never when a log is
// folded (shared/resistPrefs.ts says why at length), so this step changes what a number weighs and
// not one byte of what was observed. There is no data to rewrite and nothing to invalidate.
