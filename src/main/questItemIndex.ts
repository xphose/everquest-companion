// questItemIndex — the item→quests index built from the scraped wiki quest catalog
// The caller supplies this launch's pinned wiki catalog or the bundled offline fallback.
//
// Lifted OUT of itemLookup.ts so it can be unit-tested: itemLookup imports `electron`, which
// cannot load outside an Electron process, and tests/questCatalog.test.mts previously had to
// RE-IMPLEMENT this index to assert anything about it. A mirrored index proves nothing about
// the shipped one, so the real builder lives here and both sides import it.
//
// WHAT IT ADDS over a plain "item → quest name" map: a `required`-role use also carries the
// quest's REWARD item names. That closes the one-hop gap the UI needs — "you looted a Guard
// Bracelet; it's a turn-in for Corrupt Guards, which pays a Bunker Battle Blade" — without a
// second lookup. Law 1: the field exists only when the catalog names rewards.
