// userSounds.ts — "bring your own sound" (JOS-68), main half: the OS file picker, the copy
// into the reserved pack, and the removal.
//
// THE FILE IS COPIED, NEVER REFERENCED. An alert that pointed at
// `C:\Users\<user>\Downloads\fanfare.mp3` would go mute the day that folder is tidied, and it
// would put an absolute path in the store and across IPC. So an import reads the bytes once
// and writes them into `<userData>/my-sounds/sounds/<soundId>.<ext>` — a filename minted
// from the sanitized id, so not one byte of user-supplied path text ever reaches `join()`.
// The original filename survives only as the DISPLAY label inside manifest.json.
//
// THE PICKER IS MAIN'S. `dialog.showOpenDialog` runs here (the share / character-sheet
// precedent), so the renderer never sees a filesystem path at all: it asks, and it is told
// which sounds now exist. There is no renderer `<input type=file>` anywhere in this flow.
//
// WHAT THE PACK IS: an ordinary pack directory — `manifest.json` + `sounds/` — so
// `readManifest`, `getSoundData` and every picker read it with the code they already had.
// Only its ROOT is different (`<userData>/my-sounds/`, never inside `soundpacks/`), which is
// what makes it uncollidable with a registry pack; see shared/userSounds.ts.
//
// EVERY FILE OPERATION TAKES ITS ROOT (the maps-library pattern): the two exported entry
// points resolve `userSoundsRoot()` and everything below is Electron-free, so
// tests/userSounds.test.mts drives the real copy/remove against a temp dir.
