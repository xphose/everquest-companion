// self-heal attribution, and the held instant-clicky set. Every one of those is an ENGINE
// construction input now, pushed as a `*.define` or carried on the attach.
//
// `installClickies` reached the catalog THROUGH `pipeline.ts` on purpose — an indirection that was
// load-bearing rather than tidy, because importing it here broke JOS-431's inventory watcher. That
// hazard leaves with the module edge it was about.

// THE PARSE COUNTER IS GONE (JOS-499). It was the app's one definition of "a line this app
// parsed" — both feeders came through it — and it drove `noteLinesParsed` plus the first-run
// funnel's `firstParse` step. This process parses nothing.
//
// THE FUNNEL STEP IT MARKED IS NOT LOST: `logDetected` still fires in `tailCharacter` below, at
// the moment this app resolves a log and hands it to the engine, which is the same thing
// `firstParse` was standing in for — that a real player with a real log got as far as reading it.

// THE TAILER AND THE HEARTBEAT ARE GONE (JOS-499).
//
// `startTailer` opened the live byte tail at the scan's frozen EOF — the gapless handoff that
// made a line impossible to fold twice or never — parsed each raw line, and pushed it onto the
// bus. The ENGINE owns the tail now (boundary verdict 4), and it owns the same seam: it folds
// from byte zero and tails from where it stopped, in its own process.
//
// `startHeartbeat` was the 1 Hz wall clock that advanced each module's `onTick` so a buff could
// expire while the log was silent — the one thing a purely event-driven fold cannot do. Owner
// ruling 22 moved it: the engine ticks its own modules with its own clock while LIVE, and
// historical replay stays clockless so the equivalence law is untouched. Its 60-tick rider that
// snapped the learned message-overlay register to disk is gone with it, because that register is
// the engine's file now (JOS-497, boundary verdict 4).

// `TailResult` LIVED HERE AND IS GONE (JOS-499). Every field of it measured THIS PROCESS's own
// historical fold — events replayed, the slicer's duty cycle, bytes read, the cold-read delta,
// how long the first megabyte took — and it fed the startup profile's replay section. This
// process folds nothing, so there is no honest number to report and reporting zeros would be
// worse than reporting nothing.
//
// THE MEASUREMENT MOVED RATHER THAN DIED (owner ruling 19: the app's performance surface includes
// the engine's own numbers). Fold rate, event counts and serve latency are the ENGINE's to report
// now, over `perf.snapshot` and the perf channel `enginePerfWatch.ts` already pushes.

// THE REPLAY GATE IS GONE (JOS-499), and so is everything it gated.
//
// It existed because a historical fold ran ON THIS PROCESS and owned the message loop for the
// seconds it took: the overlays and the cursor ring came off screen (they would have been showing
// half-parsed state), the ring's 8 ms sampler stopped, and — until JOS-370 retired the mouse hook
// — every locked overlay dropped its WH_MOUSE_LL forwarding so the user's mouselook did not queue
// behind a 12 ms fold slice.
//
// THE BOUNDARY IS THE FIX THE GATE WAS AN APPROXIMATION OF. The fold is in another process at
// below-normal priority, so there is no moment when reading the log costs this process its
// responsiveness — which is the whole argument for the engine (docs/plans/data-server.md, 'the
// architecture makes politeness fragile — the fix is a boundary, not another throttle'). Nothing
// hides, nothing suspends, and the overlays simply stay where the user put them while the engine
// catches up. `presenceProtocol.ts ringDisposition` lost its replay term for the same reason.

 *
 * NULL RATHER THAN A `TailResult` because there is no honest one to give: this call folded a partial

 *
 * A missing dump is silence, not an error: on a machine where `/outputfile inventory` has never
 * been typed there is nothing to load, and the surfaces already render that as the never-run
 * state (the `/outputfile` registry's own line).
 *
 * A TIMED SEAM (JOS-458): a synchronous file read plus a parse plus a clicky re-derivation over
 * the item corpus, on main, one statement before the rebuild fan-out. The STALENESS GUARD is
 * outside the bracket and the missing-file arm is inside it, deliberately — a call that was
 * refused for the wrong character did no work and must not be counted, while a call that went to
 * the filesystem and found nothing DID, and on a cold disk that probe is the measurement.
