// keeps working exactly as it did. Import from here when you want only the store shape.

/**
 * How the app decides which items you "have". A DUMP ADDS AND NEVER SUBTRACTS (JOS-141, owner
 * ruling 2026-08-09): loading one cannot lower any count, because a dump only covers what was
 * OPEN when it was generated and reading its silence as zero deleted banked Sky items. JOS-128
 * briefly made a dump load a BASELINE that reset the model; that is reverted.
 * - 'log'       : count everything the character has ever looted (log parsing). Never consults
 *                 a dump, and therefore CANNOT see an item you destroyed, sold to a vendor or
 *                 handed to another player; "ever looted" is exactly what it says.
 * - 'inventory' : the dump, exactly as written. Never consults the log. The only source that can
 *                 show a deletion, and it does so by ignoring the log rather than by resetting.
 * - 'both'      : `max(log, dump)` per item — whichever witness can vouch for more copies. A
 *                 maximum and not a sum, because the two OVERLAP: an item you looted and still
 *                 hold is in both.
 * - 'rebaseline': THE FOURTH MODE (JOS-186, owner ruling 2026-08-14) — the dump is your STARTING
 *                 POINT and the log is trusted only FORWARD from the instant it was generated.
 *                 Every log line older than the dump is discarded for counting; every drop after
 *                 it adds. This is the one source that can LOWER a count from log evidence, and it
 *                 is opt-in for exactly that reason: it is JOS-128's reverted reset offered as a
 *                 CHOICE rather than imposed as the default, so the banked items a closed bank
 *                 window kept out of the file are the user's own accepted cost, not a surprise.
 * The combination and the turn-in consumption that follows it live in ONE place,
 * renderer/features/inventory/reconcile.ts, which argues all four.
 *
 * THE DEFAULT IS `both` SINCE JOS-294, and it used to be `log` — which meant a player who ran
 * `/outputfile inventory`, and whose dump this app loaded by itself, was counted by a source that
 * reads the file for nothing. The default, the labels the user picks between and the proof that the
 * flip changes NOTHING for an install with no dump all live in
 * renderer/features/inventory/countSource.ts.
