  // Payload: FeedReport. Fire-and-forget.
  feedReport: 'feed:report',

  // ---- celebration toasts (docs/plans/celebration-toasts.md) ----
  // renderer(main app) -> main, FIRE-AND-FORGET: "celebrate this" (ToastRequest). The producers
  // are the app's EXISTING always-mounted celebration detectors (T4), which already own the
  // live-only/replay-silence discipline — there is no second gate anywhere below this call.
  // The payload is VALIDATED AT THE HANDLER (`validateToastRequest`, shared/toast.ts): unknown
  // kinds, over-long text and unlisted focus views are dropped, never forwarded to a window.
  // Main then RESOLVES the reward item card (lookupItem) and fans out on the two channels below.
  toastShow: 'toast:show',
  // main -> renderer(toast overlay): one resolved ToastPayload to render. The overlay times,
  // stacks and dismisses it locally and fetches NOTHING (T3/T5) — everything it draws is here.
  onToast: 'toast:card',
  // (`toast:sound` lived here until 2026-08-05. A toast has no voice of its own: the seeded
  // "Raid target defeated" / "Quest complete" ALERTS speak on the same events, and a second
  // channel could only ever say it twice. Removed with the sound controls it served.)

  // ---- the alert banner (JOS-378, shared/alertBanner.ts) ----
  // renderer(main app) -> main, FIRE-AND-FORGET: "show this alert on screen" (AlertBannerPayload).
  // ONE channel for every firing path, because there is one producer: the always-mounted
  // AlertPlayer, which is where a fired alert already becomes sound and speech. Everything that
  // decides WHETHER an alert fires (enabled, cooldown, target scope) happened upstream in the
  // alerts module and is not re-asked here.
  // VALIDATED AT THE HANDLER (`validateAlertBannerPayload`): the payload is rebuilt field by
  // field, the colour is checked against a closed union and the text is capped, because it
  // crosses into a window that draws it.
  alertsBanner: 'alerts:banner',
  // main -> renderer(alertBanner overlay): one validated line to render. The overlay queues,
  // times and dismisses it locally and fetches nothing — the celebration toast's contract, on
  // the kind that shares its queue.
  onAlertBanner: 'alerts:banner-card',

  // ---- the con card (JOS-383, shared/conCard.ts) ----
  // main -> renderer(conCard overlay): one finished card for the creature just `/con`ed. There is
  // no renderer->main producer on this feature at all, which is what makes it different from the
  // banner above: the trigger is a LOG LINE, and main owns the log, the resist ledger, the mob
  // knowledge and the kill counts the card is made of. Nothing is validated on the way out because
  // nothing untrusted is on the way in — main built it — but it IS capped (shared/conCard.ts), for
  // the reason every payload that crosses into a window that draws it is.
  onConCard: 'con:card',
  // renderer(conCard overlay) -> main, FIRE-AND-FORGET: "I closed the card for this mob."
  // The overlay dismisses its own card locally; this tells main, whose business the SUPPRESSION is
  // (`CON_CARD_REOPEN_SUPPRESS_MS` — a re-con inside a minute of a close must not nag). Main
  // re-validates the key at the handler, because it is a renderer-supplied string.
  conCardClosed: 'con:card-closed',

  // ---- cross-window deep link (Task #64) ----
  // renderer(overlay) -> main: "focus the app on this" (AppFocus). Main shows/restores/focuses
  // the MAIN window and forwards the payload on `onFocusView`. Fire-and-forget; the payload's
  // `view` is re-validated at the handler against the closed AppFocusView union.
  focusView: 'app:focusView',
  // main -> renderer(main app): a deep link landed. App.tsx switches to the named view and
  // hands the target down (today: the mob to drill into).
  onFocusView: 'app:focusedView',

  // ---- the mouse's Back button (JOS-201) ----
  // main -> renderer(main app): the user pressed the browser-Back button on their mouse while
  // THIS window had focus. No payload: the message is the press, and what "back" means is a
  // question only the renderer can answer (src/renderer/src/appBack.tsx). The event is
  // WINDOW-SCOPED by construction — it originates in a BrowserWindow `app-command` handler
  // (src/main/appBack.ts), so a press landing in EverQuest, or in any other app, never reaches
  // here. There is deliberately no global hook and no forward channel.
  onAppBack: 'app:back',

  // ---- class-combo corrections (docs/plans/class-combo-inference.md § 5.3) ----
  // READS need no channel of their own — the combo module rides the generic module transport
  // (`module:getSnapshot('combo')` + `module:delta`). These two exist because a correction is a
  // WRITE: the user telling the app "that span was PAL/ROG/BER", which is persisted per
  // character and outlives every replay.
  // renderer -> main: record a correction. Payload {startTs, endTs, classes}. `classes` must be
  // a 1-3 list of the 16 ClassAbbr literals and the timestamps must be finite and ordered —
  // VALIDATED AT THE HANDLER, never trusted because today's only caller is the app's own UI.
  comboSetCorrection: 'combo:setCorrection',
  // renderer -> main: drop every correction overlapping [startTs, endTs] ("Reset to detected").
  // A TIME RANGE, not an interval id: ids are recompute-unstable by design (§ 5.4).
  comboClearCorrection: 'combo:clearCorrection',

  // ---- group-roster user edits (docs/plans/group-model.md §3) ----
  // Same shape as the combo pair above and for the same reason: the roster READS ride the
  // combat snapshot (which both the Combat tab and every overlay already poll), so only the
  // WRITES need channels. A roster edit is the user telling the app "this person is with me" or
  // "this person is not" — persisted per character, outliving every replay.
  // renderer -> main: record an edit. Payload {name, action}. The name is trimmed, length- and
  // shape-checked AT THE HANDLER (a renderer string is a renderer string) and canonicalized
  // there, so the store can never hold a key the model would not recognize.
  rosterSetEdit: 'roster:setEdit',
  // renderer -> main: forget the hand-made statement about one name — "let the log decide again".
  rosterClearEdit: 'roster:clearEdit',

  // NOTE: there are deliberately NO pet-claim channels here any more (JOS-49). The meter used to
  // ASK "<Name> — your pet?" about an unbound entity and take the answer over IPC; the owner cut
  // the question outright — "if you just have to pet attack once, this is a lot of work we can
  // get wrong." The private tell is the binding story, and it needs no renderer round trip.

  // ---- item knowledge ("what's this lore/quest item for", Task #53) ----
  // renderer -> main: look up an item's lore/quest knowledge (local posky-first, then a
  // cached, politely-throttled wiki lookup). Returns ItemKnowledge.
  itemsLookup: 'items:lookup',

  // ---- mob knowledge ("what does this thing drop", Task #63) ----
  // renderer -> main: look up a mob's drop knowledge (own loot history + local quest catalog
  // first, then a cached, politely-throttled wiki lookup). Returns MobKnowledge. Exposed on
  // BOTH bridges — the main window's "recently considered" card and the events overlay's
  // consider rows ask the same question of the same cache-first door.
  mobsLookup: 'mobs:lookup',

  // ---- exaltation planner (docs/plans/exaltation-planner.md §4.1, D1) ----
  // items.json is 7.14 MB and already inlined in MAIN's bundle, so the effect index is built
  // there and served over these channels rather than shipping the corpus to the renderer twice.
  // The index is built LAZILY on the first call and memoized for the process's lifetime.
  // renderer -> main: every effect the corpus states, one row per (item, effect). Returns
  // PlannerDonor[] (~1.5k rows, a few hundred KB) — fetched once and cached by the renderer.
  plannerDonors: 'planner:donors',
  // renderer -> main: substring search over item NAMES for the Board's host picker. Arg: query
  // (VALIDATED AT THE HANDLER — a non-string answers with no hits). Returns PlannerItemHit[],
  // capped at PLANNER_SEARCH_LIMIT.
  plannerSearchItems: 'planner:searchItems',
  // renderer -> main: the active character's saved exaltation sets. Returns ExaltPlan[] ([] when
  // the character has none — the key is optional and readers default, D4).
  plannerGetPlans: 'planner:getPlans',
  // renderer -> main: replace the active character's whole set list (plans are small). The
  // payload is re-validated AT THE HANDLER against the closed slot/socket/class allowlists
  // (src/main/planner/validate.ts) — renderer input is never trusted, here as everywhere.
  plannerSetPlans: 'planner:setPlans',
  // renderer -> main: what the active character is WEARING, read from their newest
  // `/outputfile inventory` dump and joined to the planner's slots by the hand-authored table in
  // shared/planner/inventorySlots.ts (V7, law 12). Returns PlannerInventory | null — null means
  // no dump exists, which the Inventory tab answers with its instructions card, never an error.
  // The dump is re-read on demand; the renderer re-asks when `inventory:autoReloaded` fires, so
  // typing the command in game fills the tab with no click anywhere.
  plannerInventory: 'planner:inventory',

  // ---- gear planner (JOS-283, phase 2) ----
  // renderer -> main: the GEAR CANDIDATE INDEX — one row per equippable item (~6,884 of the
  // corpus's 11,213 pages), carrying slots/classes/races/era/flags/effects, the weapon block and
  // the NUMERIC BASE stat vector. Returns GearIndexPayload (versioned; see shared/planner/gear.ts).
  // Built in main for the same reason the donor index is — items.json is already inlined here, so
  // shipping the corpus to the renderer would double it — LAZILY on first call and memoized for
  // the process. Fetched ONCE by the renderer: the rows are derived from committed bytes and
  // cannot change while the app runs, and every plus-state the user asks for is a PURE MAP over
  // them (shared/planner/gearScale.ts), never another round trip.
  gearIndex: 'gear:index',

  // ---- gear planner (JOS-285, phase 4) ----
  // renderer -> main: THE OWNERSHIP INDEX for the active character — every thing their newest
  // `/outputfile inventory` dump names, filed under the same key the gear index and the loot
  // history use (shared/planner/ownership.ts), so the Gear tab joins by `row.key` with no
  // translation. Returns OwnershipPayload; `path: null` means the command has never been run,
  // which is "there is nothing to read", never "you own nothing".
  //
  // MEMOIZED ON THE DUMP'S OWN IDENTITY (path + mtime), not on a signal somebody has to remember
  // to send: every ask re-stats the file (one readdir + one stat, the registry's own rule) and
  // re-folds only when it MOVED. So the renderer re-asking on `inventory:autoReloaded` gets the
  // new dump, and a keystroke that re-renders the table gets the cached fold.
  gearOwnership: 'gear:ownership',

  // ---- gear planner (JOS-286, phase 5) ----
  // The active character's saved GEAR SETS — named virtual loadouts, one item per equipment cell,
  // each assignment carrying its own tracked plus-state (shared/planner/gearSet.ts). Read/write
  // pair over `ProgressState.gearSets`, exactly the `planner:getPlans` / `planner:setPlans`
  // arrangement: the renderer is UNTRUSTED, so a written list is re-validated cell by cell against
  // the closed `PLAN_SLOTS` allowlist and clamped to states the game's item window can be in
  // (src/main/planner/validate.ts sanitizeGearSets) before a byte of it reaches the store — and
  // the same validator runs on the way out, so the round trip is a fixed point.
  gearGetSets: 'gear:getSets',
  gearSetSets: 'gear:setSets',

  // ---- the flat wish list (JOS-326) ----
  // The active character's WISH LIST — a flat list of items they have decided they want, with no
  // cell, socket or host structure at all (shared/planner/wishlist.ts), plus the two facts that
  // hang off it: the done strip's dismissals and the one-time exaltation-plan seed flag. Read/write
  // pair over `ProgressState.wishlist`, the same arrangement as the two documents above — the
  // renderer is UNTRUSTED, so a written list is re-validated entry by entry
  // (src/main/planner/validate.ts sanitizeWishlist) before a byte of it reaches the store, and the
  // same validator runs on the way out, so the round trip is a fixed point. WHOLE-DOCUMENT, because
  // the list and the two facts about it must move together or not at all.
  wishlistGet: 'wishlist:get',
  wishlistSet: 'wishlist:set',

  // ---- character sheet (JOS-45) ----
  // renderer -> main: the armory grid + the gear sum, built from the active character's newest
  // `/outputfile inventory` dump and joined to the committed item DB in main (where the 8.6 MB
  // corpus already lives) — and, since JOS-327, the CARRY-ALL ledger off the same parse
  // (`CharacterSheet.carry`, shared/carryAll.ts): every non-empty row of every table the dump
  // carries, with its location path and count. Returns CharacterSheet | null — null means no dump,
  // which the tab answers with its instructions card, never an error.
  //
  // IT WAS GATED UNTIL JOS-327. The handler was registered only when `UNRELEASED`
  // (src/main/unreleased.ts) was true, because the surface had not passed the owner's review gate,
  // and the preload method below still documents the reject that came of it. The owner released the
  // tab, so this is an ordinary channel now: registered in every build, answering in every build.
  characterSheet: 'character:sheet',

  // ---- map viewer (docs/plans/map-viewer.md §4.2) ----
  // Main owns `fs` and owns effectiveEqRoot(), so main reads and parses `<eqRoot>\maps` and
  // the renderer receives columnar typed arrays (~690 KB worst case, once per zone change).
  // `zone` and every packId reach a join() and are validated AT THE HANDLER (isSafePackId).
  // renderer -> main: the installed packs (no absolute paths). Returns MapPackListResult.
  mapsListPacks: 'maps:listPacks',
  // renderer -> main: zone stems, all packs or one. Args: (packId?). Returns ZoneShort[].
  mapsListZones: 'maps:listZones',
  // renderer -> main: one zone's parsed map. Args: (zone, prefs?) where prefs picks the pack
  // PER LAYER — geometry and labels routinely come from different packs (§6.3), and the
  // outcome is reported back in MapData.sources. Returns MapGetResult.
  mapsGet: 'maps:get',
  // renderer -> main: fuzzy label search — one zone (opts.zone) or the whole corpus.
  // Args: (query, opts?). Returns MapSearchHit[].
  mapsSearch: 'maps:search',

  // ---- settings / alert sharing ("profiles" — src/shared/profiles.ts) ----
  // Every call carries the renderer's whitelisted localStorage prefs (UI_PREF_SPECS): main
  // owns the electron-store half of a bundle, the renderer owns the localStorage half.
  // renderer -> main: encode the GLOBAL settings bundle. Args: (uiPrefs). Returns the string.
  shareExportSettings: 'share:exportSettings',
  // renderer -> main: encode one alert (ids:[id]) or all of them (ids omitted/empty).
  shareExportAlerts: 'share:exportAlerts',
  // renderer -> main: save an already-encoded string to a file via the OS save dialog.
  // Args: (text, suggestedName). Returns {ok, path?, canceled?}.
  shareSaveFile: 'share:saveFile',
  // renderer -> main: open a .eqshare/.txt via the OS picker and PREVIEW it. Args: (uiPrefs).
  shareOpenFile: 'share:openFile',
  // renderer -> main: decode + plan a pasted string WITHOUT writing anything. Args:
  // (text, uiPrefs). Returns SharePreview (never throws; failures come back as prose).
  sharePreview: 'share:preview',
  // renderer -> main: apply a previewed string additively. Args: (text, uiPrefs, selection).
  // Returns ShareApplyResult, incl. the localStorage writes the renderer must perform.
  shareApply: 'share:apply',

  // ---- clipboard (the combat "Copy this view as text" buttons) ----
  // renderer -> main: put plain text on the OS clipboard. Arg: text. Returns boolean (written).
  // WHY THIS IS AN IPC CHANNEL AND NOT `navigator.clipboard.writeText`: the async Clipboard API
  // is permission-gated in Chromium ('clipboard-sanitized-write'), and this app denies EVERY
  // web permission wholesale (`hardenSession` in src/main/windows.ts — deliberate, deny-by-
  // default policy). So writeText rejects with `NotAllowedError: Write permission denied.` in
  // every window, verified in the real app. Electron's main-process `clipboard` module is not a
  // web API and consults no permission, so the copy goes through here instead — the policy
  // stays shut and the feature works. The text is VALIDATED AT THE HANDLER (non-empty string,
  // length cap), never trusted because today's only caller is the app's own UI.
  clipboardWrite: 'clipboard:write',

  // ---- in-app feedback (Task #65 — docs/plans/feedback-triage.md §4.3) ----
  // renderer -> main: the dialog's header context (versions, channel, queued count,
  // whether this build has an endpoint compiled in). Returns FeedbackContext.
  feedbackContext: 'feedback:context',
  // renderer -> main: build the scrubbed log slice for a window (minutes) and return a
  // CAPPED preview + the real counts. The bytes never cross IPC — only PREVIEW_MAX_LINES
  // of text plus the metadata. Returns FeedbackSlicePreview | null.
  feedbackBuildSlice: 'feedback:buildSlice',
  // renderer -> main: save the FULL slice to disk via the OS save dialog, so a user who
  // wants to read every byte before sending can. Returns {ok, path?, canceled?}.
  feedbackSaveSlice: 'feedback:saveSlice',
  // renderer -> main: package the CURRENT `/outputfile inventory` dump and return its
  // metadata + a capped preview, or the NAMED reason there is none (JOS-296). No arguments:
  // which dump belongs to this character is main's answer, never the renderer's. The gz bytes
  // never cross. Returns FeedbackInventoryPreview.
  feedbackBuildInventory: 'feedback:buildInventory',
  // renderer -> main: the same for the CURRENT `/outputfile achievements` dump (JOS-441), on the
  // identical no-arguments terms. Returns FeedbackAchievementsPreview.
  feedbackBuildAchievements: 'feedback:buildAchievements',
  // renderer -> main: submit. Args (draft, {attachLog, windowMinutes, attachInventory,
  // attachAchievements}). Never rejects; a network failure resolves with {ok:false,
  // queued:true}. Returns SubmitResult.
  feedbackSubmit: 'feedback:submit',

  // ---- usage analytics (docs/plans/usage-analytics.md wave A1) ------------------------
  //
  // NONE OF THESE CAN PUT A BYTE ON THE WIRE. They move events into the local ring, read and
  // write the switch, and render the payload viewer. The only thing that transmits is main's
  // flush loop, gated in src/main/telemetry/net.ts — there is no "send now" channel, on purpose.
  //
  // renderer -> main, FIRE-AND-FORGET: record one event. The payload is VALIDATED AT THE
  // HANDLER with the shared `validateTelemetryEvent` — the renderer is untrusted here like
  // everywhere else, and the schema is a closed allowlist, so an unknown tag or an unlisted
  // enum member is dropped rather than buffered. Arg: TelemetryEvent.
  telemetryTrack: 'telemetry:track',
  // renderer -> main: the persisted prefs {enabled, noticeShown, analyticsId}. Returns
  // TelemetryPrefs.
  telemetryPrefsGet: 'telemetryPrefs:get',
  // renderer -> main: flip the master switch. OFF drops the local buffer immediately.
  // Arg: boolean. Returns TelemetryPrefs.
  telemetrySetEnabled: 'telemetry:setEnabled',
  // renderer -> main: the first-run notice has been ANSWERED (or dismissed — dismissal keeps
  // it on, that is what opt-out means). Sets noticeShown either way. Arg: boolean (keep on).
  telemetryNoticeShown: 'telemetry:noticeShown',
  // renderer -> main: mint a new anonymous analyticsId and DROP the local buffer (T3).
  // Returns TelemetryPrefs.
  telemetryRotate: 'telemetry:rotate',
  // renderer -> main: everything the Preferences payload viewer renders — prefs, whether this
  // build has an endpoint at all, the live buffer, and the last batch sent (permanently null
  // while dark). Returns TelemetryPayloadView.
  telemetryPayload: 'telemetry:payload',

  // ---- what's new (JOS-73; shared/releaseNotes.ts) --------------------------------------
  //
  // TWO CHANNELS, AND THE NOTES THEMSELVES CROSS NEITHER. `src/shared/releaseNotes.ts` is
  // committed source that the bundler inlines into the renderer, exactly like the spell DB — so
  // the only thing main owns here is the ONE store key that says which release this install has
  // already been shown. Everything the user sees is derived from that string by a pure function.
  // renderer -> main: the stored last-seen release, or null on a fresh install. Returns string|null.
  releaseNotesSeenGet: 'releaseNotes:getSeen',
  // renderer -> main: stamp it (the panel, on open) or CLEAR it with null (the DEV variant
  // control's "pretend fresh install"). Arg: string|null, validated at the handler. Returns
  // what is now stored.
  releaseNotesSeenSet: 'releaseNotes:setSeen',

  // ---- performance HUD + startup profile (docs/plans/perf-profiling.md) ----------------
  //
  // NOTHING ON THIS CHANNEL SET COSTS ANYTHING WHILE THE HUD IS OFF. Main creates no timer at
  // all until `perf:setEnabled` says so, so an install that never opens the section never sees
  // a single `perf:sample`.
  //
  // main -> renderer, PUSH: one `PerfSample` every 2 s while the HUD is enabled — or `null`,
  // sent exactly once when it is switched off, which is how the title-bar chip learns to
  // disappear instead of freezing on the last numbers it saw.
  onPerfSample: 'perf:sample',
  // renderer -> main: the persisted HUD pref ({enabled}). Returns PerfHudPrefs.
  perfPrefsGet: 'perfPrefs:get',
  // renderer -> main: flip the HUD switch. Starts/stops the sampler in the SAME call, so the
  // pref and this session's timers can never disagree. A non-boolean leaves the pref alone.
  // Arg: boolean. Returns PerfHudPrefs.
  perfSetEnabled: 'perf:setEnabled',
  // renderer -> main: the last startup profile — the launch you are in (it is written to disk
  // for the next one). Returns StartupProfile. Read by Preferences → Performance.
  perfGetStartup: 'perf:getStartup',
  // renderer -> main, FIRE-AND-FORGET: "the renderer has mounted" — the `rendererHydrated`
  // startup phase, which only the renderer can observe. Sent once per window lifetime; a
  // repeat is refused by the phase accounting itself (shared/perf.ts `addMark`).
  perfRendererHydrated: 'perf:rendererHydrated',
  // ---- the ENGINE's row in that panel (JOS-483, owner ruling 19) ------------------------
  //
  // > "i want to see the server in the cpu/performance overlay in app."
  //
  // TWO CHANNELS, AND THE WATCH ONE IS THE INTERESTING HALF. The engine's numbers cost a
  // loopback round trip (`perf.snapshot`) plus a native per-pid read, and the ENGINE section
  // is a few hundred pixels inside a popover that is open for seconds at a time. So main
  // polls ONLY while the renderer says the panel is open: a perf surface that cost a round
  // trip a second while nobody was looking at it would be the bug it exists to find.
  //
  // renderer -> main: "the performance panel is open" / "it is closed". Starts and stops the
  // engine poll in the SAME call, so the panel and this session's timers can never disagree —
  // the `perf:setEnabled` discipline. A non-boolean is ignored. Arg: boolean. Returns void.
  perfEngineWatch: 'perf:engineWatch',
  // main -> renderer, PUSH: one `EnginePerfSample` every 2 s while the panel is being watched
  // AND an engine exists — or `null`, which is the honest "there is nothing to draw here":
  // the flag is off, this build has no engine binary, or the watch just stopped. The section
  // hides on it rather than freezing on the last numbers it saw.
  onEnginePerf: 'perf:engine',

  // renderer -> main: the persisted "yield CPU to the game" pref ({yieldToGame}). ON by default.
  // Returns ProcessPriorityPrefs.
  processPriorityGet: 'processPriority:get',
  // renderer -> main: flip it. The priority class of main + every renderer is re-applied in the
  // SAME call, so the pref and this session's processes can never disagree (the `perf:setEnabled`
  // discipline). A non-boolean leaves the pref alone. Arg: boolean. Returns ProcessPriorityPrefs.
  processPrioritySet: 'processPriority:setYield',

  // ---- graphics compatibility (JOS-40 — shared/graphicsPrefs.ts) ------------------------
  //
  // Two switches for machines whose driver dislikes what this app draws: software rendering
  // for the whole app, and opaque (non-transparent) overlay windows. NEITHER takes effect on
  // the call — safe mode is a before-`ready` flag (next launch) and a window's transparency is
  // fixed at construction (next overlay open) — so there is deliberately no "apply now" channel
  // to pretend otherwise.
  //
  // renderer -> main: the persisted blob {safeMode, opaqueOverlays}. Returns GraphicsPrefs.
  graphicsPrefsGet: 'graphicsPrefs:get',
  // renderer -> main: merge-patch the blob. VALIDATED AT THE HANDLER through the same
  // normalizer the store reader and the 10→11 migration use. Returns what was stored.
  graphicsPrefsSet: 'graphicsPrefs:set',
  // renderer -> main: what this MACHINE recommends, for a switch left on 'auto' (JOS-31).
  // Returns a `GraphicsEnvironment` (shared/wineDetect.ts): whether a Wine prefix was detected,
  // which signals said so, and the two booleans `resolveGraphics` folds against the stored prefs.
  //
  // A SEPARATE CHANNEL, not a fatter `graphicsPrefs:get`, because the two answer different
  // questions with different lifetimes: the prefs change when the user flips a switch, and this is
  // a fact about the launch that cannot change while the app is running. The renderer hydrates it
  // once and re-folds locally through the SAME `resolveGraphics` main used, so the card can never
  // describe a precedence the windows did not use.
  graphicsEnvGet: 'graphicsPrefs:env',

  // ---- the buff externals allowlist (JOS-140 — shared/buffTrust.ts) ----------------------
  //
  // WHOSE spells the buff/debuff model is allowed to track. It ships EMPTY — you and nobody else
  // — because a landing sentence names no caster, so in a crowded zone the only thing separating
  // your work from a stranger's is that you have a cast line and they do not. An allowlisted name
  // gets the IDENTICAL rule, anchored on `<Name> begins casting <Spell>.`; it is never a looser
  // one, and never something the app infers from proximity or from the group roster.
  //
  // renderer -> main: the persisted `{externals: string[]}`. Returns BuffTrustPrefs.
  buffTrustGet: 'buffTrust:get',
  // renderer -> main: replace the list. VALIDATED AT THE HANDLER through the same normalizer the
  // store reader uses (the `graphicsPrefs:set` rule), and applied to the live model on the way
  // through so a name added mid-session anchors the next cast rather than the next launch.
  // Returns what was stored.
  buffTrustSet: 'buffTrust:set',

  // ---- the buff/debuff TRACKING ALLOW-LIST (JOS-168 — shared/buffAllow.ts) ---------------
  //
  // WHICH of your spells the two timer OVERLAY windows may draw: a mode switch that lives on the
  // Buffs tab, and a tri-state verdict per spell line behind it. It is a DISPLAY filter over those
  // two windows and nothing else — the model, the Buffs tab list and its header count are
  // untouched (JOS-215's law).
  //
  // IT IS IPC RATHER THAN RENDERER STATE FOR ONE REASON: the window that SETS it (the Buffs tab,
  // in the main window) is not the window that OBEYS it (the buffs/debuffs overlays, separate
  // BrowserWindows with their own localStorage). Main is the only process that can reach both,
  // which is the fight-selection/scope-selection argument — except that this one is PERSISTED,
  // because a choice about which spells you track is not a thing you re-make every launch.
  //
  // renderer(any window) -> main: the persisted allow-list, for hydrating a window that mounted
  // after the last change. Returns BuffAllowPrefs.
  buffAllowGet: 'buffAllow:get',
  // renderer(main app) -> main: a PARTIAL — the mode, some verdicts, or both. Each control sets
  // what it touches and no more, so a checkbox never has to restate the mode. REBUILT AT THE
  // HANDLER through the same normalizer the store reader uses (`applyBuffAllowPatch`), persisted,
  // and fanned out. Returns what was stored.
  buffAllowSet: 'buffAllow:set',
  // main -> the main window + the two timer overlays: the allow-list changed. Payload is the whole
  // `BuffAllowPrefs`. This is the half that makes a checkbox reach an ALREADY-OPEN overlay within
  // one delta rather than at the next launch.
  onBuffAllow: 'buffAllow:changed',

  // ---- respawn clocks (JOS-194 — shared/respawn.ts) -------------------------------------
  //
  // WHICH MOBS GET A CLOCK. The clocks themselves are log-derived and ride the generic module
  // transport (`respawn`); this pair carries the ONE thing the log cannot state — the mobs you
  // chose to watch and the respawn you typed for them.
  //
  // main -> renderer: the persisted watch list. Returns RespawnPrefs.
  respawnGet: 'respawn:get',
  // renderer -> main: replace it. VALIDATED AT THE HANDLER through the same normalizer the store
  // reader uses, applied to the running module, and PUSHED immediately (`registry.flushNow`) —
  // the module's own revision counter is what keeps the push from being deduped, because a watch
  // edit advances no log seq (JOS-87). Returns what was stored.
  respawnSet: 'respawn:set',
  // renderer -> main: "that sighting WAS the spawn — start this row's clock from it" (owner
  // ruling, prototype round 3). The app never does this on its own: a sighting proves the mob is
  // up and says nothing about when it spawned, so re-basing a clock is a judgement and needs a
  // click. Payload is the ROW ID the surfaces already draw; main re-checks that the row exists and
  // is currently seen. Returns whether it took effect. Called from the Timers tab AND from an
  // INTERACTIVE floating window (a locked one is click-through and has no clicks to give).
  respawnConfirmSighting: 'respawn:confirmSighting',
  // renderer -> main: "stop watching this mob" (owner ruling, prototype round 4). The same write
  // `respawnSet` could express, given its own channel because it is called from surfaces that have
  // no business holding the whole watch list: a clock row and an INTERACTIVE floating window each
  // know one mob, and handing either of them the entire list to rewrite would be a second place
  // that can lose a watch the user did not touch. Payload is the canonical mob KEY the rows
  // already carry; main removes it through the shared pure helper, persists, applies to the
  // running module and pushes (`registry.flushNow`) exactly as the setter does. Returns whether
  // anything was actually watching that name — false is a no-op, not a failure.
  respawnUnwatch: 'respawn:unwatch',

  // ---- per-mob resist profiles (JOS-382 — docs/plans/resist-mining.md) -------------------
  //
  // A PULL, NOT A SUBSCRIPTION, and the reason is the size of the thing being read: the resist
  // ledger is ~700 kB of pooled observations and the only consumer wants ONE mob out of it at a
  // time, on a page the user has to navigate to. Mirroring it into the renderer over
  // `module:delta` would ship the whole ledger to draw five rows. So the module (id `resist`)
  // pushes no increments, exactly as the combat engine does not, and these two channels answer
  // the question the screen is actually asking.
  //
  // Both DERIVE on every call. Nothing about a resist stat is stored — not R, not the interval,
  // not "nearly immune" — because a stored verdict is a second opinion waiting to disagree with
  // the derived one, and because the answer legitimately moves as the user plays.
  //
  // renderer -> main: (mobDisplayName) -> MobResistProfile. Five axis rows, always, in one order.
  resistProfile: 'resist:profile',
  // renderer -> main: (mobDisplayName, axis) -> the evidence behind one row: the estimate, its
  // per-spell breakdown, and the rows themselves. Null when the client's spell data is missing.
  resistCell: 'resist:cell',
  // Which casters teach the profiles (JOS-385 — shared/resistPrefs.ts). Returns ResistPrefs.
  //
  // A PREFERENCE, NOT A RE-FOLD. `includeNpcCasters` is read when a card is DRAWN, so setting it
  // writes one boolean and returns; the next `resist:profile` pull is already the new answer. No
  // ledger is touched, nothing is invalidated, and flipping it back costs the same nothing.
  resistPrefsGet: 'resist:prefs:get',
  // Arg: Partial<ResistPrefs>. A malformed value leaves the pref alone. Returns ResistPrefs.
  resistPrefsSet: 'resist:prefs:set',

  // ---- main window text size (JOS-123 — shared/uiScale.ts) ------------------------------
  //
  // The main window's zoom factor: the Preferences control a player asked for after reporting
  // they could barely read the app. The floating overlays are NOT on this channel and never
  // were — they carry their own `textScale` inside the per-kind overlay config, because an
  // overlay scales only its reading matter and keeps its chrome laid out against a small window.
  //
  // renderer -> main: the persisted factor. Returns a number (1 on every store that predates it).
  uiScaleGet: 'uiScale:get',
  // renderer -> main: store a factor and APPLY it to the live window in the same call. Unlike the
  // graphics switches above this one takes effect immediately, which is not a courtesy: a size
  // control you have to relaunch to evaluate cannot be evaluated. Returns what was stored, snapped
  // to the ladder by the same normalizer the store reader and the window factory use.
  uiScaleSet: 'uiScale:set',

  // ---- dev restart (JOS-61, JOS-63 — src/main/devRestart.ts) ----------------------------
  //
  // renderer -> main: restart the app. Hand-testing startup performance means restarting it
  // over and over, and Preferences → Performance already prints the breakdown of the launch
  // you are in; this is the button beside that readout.
  //
  // The reply is a `DevRestartResult` (shared/devRestart.ts) rather than a boolean, because
  // there are three outcomes and they look different to the person who clicked: the process is
  // going away now, the electron-vite watcher has been ASKED to rebuild and relaunch us (a
  // couple of seconds, and the only route that does not blank the window under `npm run dev`),
  // or nothing happened at all.
  //
  // UNLIKE THE TRIAGE CHANNELS BELOW, THIS HANDLER IS REGISTERED IN EVERY BUILD — and REFUSES
  // in a packaged one, having done nothing (src/main/ipc/dev.ts). A packaged
  // build is therefore provably inert even if the channel is reached, rather than relying on
  // the renderer surface having been stripped (it has been: `DEV_TOOLS`, anchored on
  // `import.meta.env.DEV`, deletes the button from those bytes). Takes no arguments, so there
  // is nothing at this handler to validate.
  devRestart: 'dev:restart',

  // ---- feedback TRIAGE (the OWNER-only operator tab — src/main/triage/**) --------------
  //
  // ========= OWNER OPT-IN ONLY. NO SHIPPED APP EVER REGISTERS THESE HANDLERS. =============
  //
  // The names live here because every channel name in this app lives here — but nothing in a
  // packaged build listens on them, and since JOS-72 nothing in an ordinary dev build does
  // either. Registration happens from `src/main/index.ts` behind `if (!OWNER_TOOLS) return`
  // via a dynamic import — DEV **and** an explicit `EQ_OWNER_TOOLS=1` that no fresh checkout
  // has (src/shared/ownerTools.ts; a self-compiled build from this public repo is not
  // `app.isPackaged`, which is what the old predicate had missed) — and the module it imports
  // reaches `pg` + `@aws-sdk/*`, which are devDependencies and therefore never packaged.
  // Calling one of these from a shipped build rejects with "No handler registered", which is
  // the correct and intended outcome.
  //
  // These channels read the OWNER'S FEEDBACK BACKLOG (Aurora DSQL + S3) using the launching
  // shell's AWS profile (AWS_PROFILE, default 'eqc'). Possession of those IAM credentials is
  // the access control; there is no password and no server-side read API to secure.
  //
  // Every argument is VALIDATED AT THE HANDLER (src/main/triage/validate.ts) — `reportId`
  // reaches a file path as well as a SQL parameter and must be a 26-character ULID. Every
  // reply is a `TriageResult<T>` (never a rejection), so an IAM denial renders as prose.
  //
  // renderer -> main: the filtered backlog. Arg: TriageListQuery. Returns TriageRow[].
  triageList: 'triage:list',
  // renderer -> main: one full record + the S3-resolved log state. Arg: reportId.
  triageDetail: 'triage:detail',
  // renderer -> main: download (cached) + gunzip a report's log slice and return CAPPED text.
  // The gz bytes never cross; at most PREVIEW_MAX_LINES lines do. Arg: reportId.
  triageSlice: 'triage:slice',
  // renderer -> main: the triage-only writes (status/severity/cluster/dupe/note). Args:
  // (reportId, TriagePatch). `issueUrl` is deliberately NOT writable from the UI.
  triagePatch: 'triage:patch',
  // renderer -> main: §3.5 forget — strip the contact, delete the slice object, keep the
  // report. Arg: reportId.
  triageForget: 'triage:forget',
  // renderer -> main: the kill switch + block list. Returns TriageOpsState.
  triageOps: 'triage:ops',
  // renderer -> main: set the kill switch. POSITIVE polarity — `accepting:false` is what the
  // CLI spells `closed on`. Args: (accepting, message?).
  triageSetAccepting: 'triage:setAccepting',
  // renderer -> main: block/unblock one install. Args: (installId, blocked, reason).
  triageSetBlocked: 'triage:setBlocked',
  // renderer -> main: the CLI's markdown digest + its deterministic clusters. Arg: query.
  triageDigest: 'triage:digest',
  // renderer -> main: usage analytics over a window (arg: days, one of TRIAGE_ANALYTICS_DAYS).
  // Reads usage_daily + usage_funnel_daily + analytics_install; `available:false` means the
  // tables are missing (a cluster that predates the A2 migration), NOT that they are empty.
  triageAnalytics: 'triage:analytics',

  // ---- the data server's renderer brokerage (JOS-484, docs/plans/data-server.md ruling 7) ----
  //
  // TWO CHANNELS FOR ONE HANDSHAKE, because a MessagePort is TRANSFERRED and never returned: an
  // `invoke` reply is structured-cloned and a port cannot survive that, so the port travels on the
  // push below and the invoke only says whether one was sent.
  //
  // renderer -> main: open this window's ONE connection to the engine. Arg: a numeric nonce the
  // renderer minted, echoed on the push so a window that asked twice can tell the answers apart.
  // Answers `{ok:false, reason}` when no engine is running on this launch — since JOS-495 that is
  // `EQC_ENGINE=0` or a checkout carrying no binary, not the default it used to be. Main's whole
  // gate for the feature is one function (src/main/dataServer/engineHost.ts).
  engineConnect: 'engine:connect',
  // main -> renderer: the port, with the launch's token beside it. `event.ports[0]` is one end of a
  // `MessageChannelMain` whose other end main is pumping RAW SOCKET BYTES through — main never
  // parses a frame (src/main/dataServer/rendererBroker.ts states why that is the whole design).
  // The token stays in the preload's closure and in the client it serves; it is never persisted,
  // never put in the DOM, and dies with the renderer.
  onEnginePort: 'engine:port',
  // main -> renderer, PUSH: one `EngineLaunchSay` whenever the engine's LAUNCH state changes
  // (JOS-503) — the historical fold's progress while one is running, and the reason it will not
  // start when it will not. Never null: there is always a launch state, and `starting` is the
  // honest one before anything has happened. Pushed on change only, never polled; during a fold
  // that is the engine's own ~4 Hz progress cadence and nothing at all once it is live.
  onEngineLaunch: 'engine:launch',
  // renderer -> main: what `onEngineLaunch` last pushed. Not a poll — the ONE read a window makes
  // on mount, because a push-only channel leaves a renderer that started (or reloaded) after the
  // engine failed with no way to learn about a state that will never change again.
  // Returns: EngineLaunchSay.
  engineLaunchState: 'engine:launchState',
  // renderer -> main: the failure card's RETRY button. Forgives the crash-loop trail, cancels any
  // pending backoff and launches now (src/main/dataServer/supervisor.ts `restart`). A respawn is a
  // launch (spawn contract rule 5), so this is a fresh token, port and epoch world. Returns void.
