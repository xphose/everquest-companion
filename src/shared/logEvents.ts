 * This is how random proper-named SUMMONED pets (Vebarn, Garer, …), which never appear in a
 * charm line, get bound to you. Charmed pets also emit it (harmlessly — they're already bound
 * via the charm line).
 *
 * ITS ONE BLIND SPOT, and JOS-47 is what measured it: the tell fires only when the pet is
 * ORDERED. `/pet attack` produces "Attacking X Master."; `/pet back off` on a mezzed mob
 * produces the wake-failure variant. A pet that engages on its OWN aggro emits nothing
 * private at all — so a player who never types a pet command has a pet this signal can never
 * bind, and 13,555 points of it went unrecorded in the reporter's 30-minute slice.
 *
 * `via: 'leader'` — THE `/pet who leader` ANSWER (JOS-52), which is the ON-DEMAND way out of
 * that blind spot:
 *   `<Name> says, 'My leader is <You>.'`
 * A player who has never ordered their pet can type one command and have it say whose it is.
 * Unlike the six pet-voiced sentences in `PetSayEvent`, this one NAMES ITS OWNER, so it is a
 * bind and not a nomination — but unlike the tell it is BROADCAST, so the leader's name is the
 * entire guard and the parser refuses every line naming anyone but the tailed character (see
 * classifyPetLeader for the guard, its measurement, and the one forgery it cannot rule out).
 *
 * The two are the SAME fact and therefore the same kind: every consumer (combat ingest's
 * world.claim + JOS-54 succession, modules/buffs.ts's buff-entity succession,
 * modules/progression.ts's pet ledger, the alerts vocabulary) binds identically, which is the

 *     replacement) — one per special the new loadout confers. It is also how a lane RESETS: that
 *     burst's `Kick while auto attacking.` put the kick lane back to plain Kick, and the
 *     skill-up stream agrees exactly (Flying Kick ticks stop dead, Kick ticks resume).
 *   - the `instead of` form is an UPGRADE WITHIN A LANE: Tiger Claw → Eagle Strike → Dragon
 *     Punch, Kick → Round Kick → Flying Kick, Bash ↔ Slam.

 * A CLASS BECAME AVAILABLE AS A PRIMARY — `You have completed achievement: Primary Class Unlock
 * - Paladin` (JOS-148). The one line the game prints that states an unlock outright, and

 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL, measured rather than assumed. The Sky class tests are supposed to unlock
 * their class (external claim, eqlwiki Plane_of_Sky), so the obvious model is "all M turn-ins
 * therefore unlocked". That model is INCOMPLETE, and the owner's own log is the counterexample:
 * a full Sky turn-in circuit on 2026-08-09 (26 completed trades across 14 of the 16 givers)
 * printed NOTHING but `You gain experience!` — no achievement, no reward line — while the ONE
 * first-person unlock line in all 1,461,881 lines fired at `Welcome to level 11!` in a dungeon,
 * for Paladin, on a character that had never handed a Sky giver anything. A class unlocks from
 * the level-11 primary pick, from the free level-50 token and from a bought token, and none of
 * those leaves a turn-in behind. So turn-ins are evidence of PROGRESS and this line is evidence
 * of the ANSWER, and a tab that had only the first would call an unlocked class locked.
 *
 * SELF ONLY, and that is a choice rather than a limitation of the grammar. The third-person
 * `<Name> has completed achievement: Primary Class Unlock - <Class>` does exist (3 lines,
 * strangers) and stays `{kind:'unknown'}` deliberately: a stranger's unlock is not a fact about
 * this character, and the only consumer asks what THIS character can play. Anchoring on
 * `You have completed achievement: ` is also what makes the rule safe, because the classifier
 * sees the message with its `[timestamp] ` prefix already stripped, so a chat line quoting the
 * sentence begins with the speaker's name and can never reach it.
 *
 * THE CLASS NAME IS CARRIED VERBATIM (law 2: canonicalize at boundaries, display raw). Matching
 * it to the bundled Sky data's spelling is the RENDERER's job, case-insensitively, because the
 * parser has no business importing a quest catalog and a pre-translated name would put the
 * alias in two places.
 *
 * MEASURED before it existed: all 155 lines of the achievement family (113 `You have completed
 * achievement:` plus the reward/token siblings) parsed as `{kind:'unknown'}`, so this rule can
 * neither shadow nor be shadowed by anything already in the cascade.
 *
 * WHAT THIS LINE CANNOT SAY, stated rather than papered over: no class in the owner's log is
 * anywhere near a complete Sky set (best is 3 of 7), so nothing here witnesses a Sky-DRIVEN
 * unlock. That the last turn-in prints this same line is a wiki claim, and the tab is written
 * so it never has to be true.

 * WHAT IT IS NOT, and this correction is JOS-79: it is not an item CASTING a spell. Wave 3 read
 * it that way — the next line is `You begin casting <Spell>.` in the same second — and had the
 * combo module discard any cast within 2.5 s after one. MEASURED whole-log (1.43M lines,
 * 2026-08-06) that reading is wrong three times over:
 *   * FIVE items print the line and every one the catalog knows is a FOCUS item — Djarn's
 *     Amethyst Ring / Spell Haste II, Idol of the Underking / Improved Healing III, Polished
 *     Mithril Mask / Improved Damage II, Golden Efreeti Boots / Enhancement Haste II. A focus
 *     is worn and passive; it speaks when it modifies a spell YOU cast.
 *   * A clicky casts ONE spell. Djarn's ring precedes 7,033 casts across the player's whole
 *     spellbook, era by era.
 *   * The two healing/damage focuses precede a cast on only 2.0% of their firings (48 of 2,408;
 *     25 of 1,281) — they fire when the spell LANDS. An item that cast would print one always.
 * The rule cost 7,452 of 16,857 own casts (44.2%) and every WIZ observation in the log, which
 * is why a wizard loadout was undetectable. `modules/comboEvidence.ts` carries the full note.
 *
 * WHY IT IS STILL ITS OWN EVENT: 7,749 of these lines were `{kind:'unknown'}` and 172 were
 * being swept into the spell-emote candidate stream (below). Claiming them is worth it on its
 * own; they simply say nothing about the wearer's classes, in either direction.
 *
 * `item` is the RAW display name including any trailing ` (Exaltation)` — law 2: canonicalize
 * at counting boundaries, display what the game printed. Nothing keys off it today; it exists
 * so a future consumer can say WHICH item spoke.
 *
 * CASCADE PLACEMENT: immediately before the permissive spell-landing-emote matcher. 7,749 of
 * the 7,921 lines were `{kind:'unknown'}`; the other 172 (`Your Idol of the Underking feels
 * alive with power.`, the variant with no ` (Exaltation)` for the emote's name pattern to trip
 * over) were being swept into the emote CANDIDATE stream with a subject of "Your Idol of the
 * Underking". Claiming them here was proven inert: a full-log BuffsModule replay produces a
 * byte-identical snapshot before and after (see the wave commit message).
