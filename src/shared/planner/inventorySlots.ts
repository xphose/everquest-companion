// planner/inventorySlots.ts — WHAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY WEARING, in the planner's own slot vocabulary
// (V7, docs/plans/planner-v2.md).
//
// Two closed sets that describe the same eighteen places on a character and agree about almost
// none of the spellings, because they come from different worlds: `EQUIP_LOCATIONS`
// (shared/outputs/inventory.ts) is what the CLIENT writes into a `/outputfile inventory` dump,
// and `EquipSlot` (./types.ts) is normalized from WIKI tokens. `Fingers` vs `FINGER`, `Any Slot`
// with no wiki counterpart at all.
//
// SO THE JOIN IS A HAND-AUTHORED TABLE (law 12: cross-source renames are knowledge, never fuzzy),
// and the outputs model asked for exactly this in writing when it declined to reconcile the two
// itself. Every one of the twenty client tokens is listed below — the eighteen that name a wiki
// slot, and the two that deliberately name none:
//
//   * `Any Slot` is the client's spelling for a slot-agnostic equipment slot. It is a real place
//     to wear something and it is not one of the eighteen, so it maps to no SLOT rather than to a
//     guess about which slot the wearer meant. JOS-104 gave it what it was always missing — a
//     CELL: `ANY_CELL_LOCATIONS` below routes it to `ANY_CELLS`, and this table still says null,
//     because "names no equip slot" is exactly what is true about it.
//   * `Held` is the same story from the other side: the wiki's PRIMARY/SECONDARY split does not
//     exist in that token, and picking one would be inventing which hand. It gets no cell either —
//     an any-cell would be a lie about where the thing is worn.
//
// AND THE DUMP IS WHERE WE LEARNED HOW MANY OF EACH YOU WEAR (JOS-67, and JOS-104 after it).
// `Ear`, `Wrist` and `Fingers` each print TWICE at top level in the committed 295-line dump —
// which is the game itself stating the pair rule that `PLAN_SLOTS` encodes — and so does
// `Any Slot`, which is the game stating that there are two of those too. The table below is
// unchanged in kind: a client token names a SLOT (or honestly names none), and how many cells
// exist is types.ts's answer, not this table's.
//
// PURE: types plus a fold, no fs and no Electron, so both tsconfigs see it and the node runner
// drives it against the real 295-line dump (`tests/plannerInventory.test.mts`).
