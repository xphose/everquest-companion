// ============================================================================
// planner/ownership.ts — DO I OWN THIS, WHERE IS IT, AND AT WHAT +N (JOS-282,
// Gear Planner phase 1).
// ============================================================================
//
// A PURE FOLD over the deep inventory model (`shared/outputs/inventory.ts`) into the one
// question a gear planner asks about every candidate item: does the player already have it,
// in which of the six places the dump can name, and at which upgrade level. No fs, no
// Electron, no renderer deps — both tsconfigs see it and the node runner imports it directly
// (`tests/plannerOwnership.test.mts`).
//
// It lives beside `inventorySlots.ts` rather than in `outputs/` for one stated reason: it
// JOINS the client's Location tokens to the planner's `EquipSlot` vocabulary, and the outputs
// model declines to do that on purpose ("deliberately NOT reconciled … a future character
// sheet that needs the join gets a hand-authored, evidence-verified table", law 12). That
// table is `SLOT_OF_LOCATION`, right next door, and this module READS it — it never
// re-derives a second opinion about which client token is which wiki slot.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE KEY, AND WHY LOOT HISTORY CAN JOIN ON IT
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// One key rule, spelled by ONE function the whole tree already agrees on: strip the ` +N`
// suffix, fold case (law 2 — canonicalize at COUNTING boundaries, display raw). It has three
// homes because three layers cannot import each other, and they are pinned to agree:
//
//   * `shared/itemStats.ts itemTierKey`   — the shared spelling. THIS module calls it.
//   * `main/itemsDb.ts itemKey`           — `itemBaseName(name).toLowerCase()`, i.e. the same
//                                           two calls; the committed item corpus is filed
//                                           under it, so an ownership row joins a candidate
//                                           row by key with no translation.
//   * `renderer/lib/itemName.ts itemCountKey` — the loot/quest counting key.
//
// `tests/itemTierWindows.test.mts` already asserts `itemTierKey === itemCountKey` on every
// distinct `+N` name in the real log; `tests/plannerOwnership.test.mts` re-states it for this
// index and for `itemVariantLevel` vs the tier this module records, so the loot-history join
// cannot drift.
//
// A DUMP NAME CARRIES DECORATIONS THE LOOT LINE NEVER DOES — a trailing `*` and the client's
// own ` (Exaltation)` marker. Those are split off by the dump's own parser
// (`parseItemName`), and the shared key function is applied to what is LEFT. So the key is
// still spelled by `itemTierKey` and nothing here invents a second strip rule.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// +N IS A ROW, NOT A KEY (the design decision this module is built on)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A `+2` in the bank and a `+0` on your head are TWO ownership rows under ONE key. Folding
// them would answer "do you own a Cloak of Flames" and destroy "at what +N", which is half
// the question — and with phase 0 (`shared/itemUpgrade.ts`) every stat depends on the plus
// state, so a planner that loses the tier cannot compute anything. `tier` is therefore
// per-row and OPTIONAL: ordinary native export names without a suffix establish base tier 0;
// special or malformed names can remain unknown. Raw suffix parsing and loot names are separate.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// BAG CONTENTS vs EXALTATION SOCKETS (both are `-Slot<n>`; keep them apart)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The outputs header is explicit that the file does NOT say which a child row is: a bag's
// contents and an item's exaltation sockets are both spelled `<parent>-Slot<n>`, and `Slots`
// is only "how many child slots this row provides". Two signals exist, and `containment`
// uses them in this order:
//
//   1. The CHILD'S OWN NAME. `<Item> (Exaltation)` is the client stating it, and it is the
//      only certain signal the file gives. It wins outright.
//   2. THE PLACE KIND of the row's base token. A `-Slot<n>` hanging one level off a NUMBERED
//      CONTAINER (`General 3`, `Bank7`, `SharedBank2`, `Personal-Depot1`) is that container's
//      contents; anything else nested is a socket. An equipment slot holds gear, not a bag.
//
// HONEST LIMIT: rule 2 is the dump's naming convention doing the work, not a column. A
// socketed exaltation whose name did NOT carry the marker, sitting one level under a General
// slot, would read as bag contents. No dump in this repo contains such a row — every socket
// row in the committed 295-line dump spells `(Exaltation)` — and `looksLikeContainer()` is
// the outputs model's opt-in structural guess for a caller that wants a second opinion. This
// module does not bake that guess in; it reports what the file states.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE KEYRING, AND THE `Activated` EXCLUSION THIS MODULE INHERITS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Keyring rows are ownership — a reporter's Plane of Sky quest items lived on his `Equipment`
// keyring and NOWHERE else — so they are indexed, with `where: 'keyring'` and a count of 1
// per row (the table has no Count column; a copy is a row).
//
// WHICH categories count is NOT this module's decision. It reads `HELD_KEYRING_CATEGORIES`
// (shared/outputs/inventory.ts), today a set of one, and inherits the exclusion documented at
// inventory.ts:337-351 VERBATIM in its reasoning: `Activated` stays OUT under the
// awaiting-sample law. Its single observed member whole-corpus is `Guise of the Deceiver`, an
// illusion clicky, and one row is no evidence about whether that category holds a COPY or a
// RECEIPT for a consumed item. JOS-185 recorded wiki evidence pointing the other way (the
// live client's Activated Items Key Ring is described as a bin you PLACE NONEXPENDABLE items
// in) and deliberately did not act on it, because the bar is a dump and a wiki sentence is
// not one. THE DAY THAT CATEGORY GRADUATES, IT GRADUATES THERE AND THIS INDEX FOLLOWS FOR
// FREE — do not add a second roster here, and do not guess.
//
// `Empty`/blank rows never become ownership: an `Empty` row is the client stating that a slot
// was ENUMERATED, never that anything is in it.
