// planner/gear.ts — the GEAR PLANNER's candidate row: one equippable item, described in NUMBERS
// (JOS-283, phase 2 of the gear planner; the builder is src/main/planner/gearIndex.ts).
//
// THE ONE DESIGN RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO SERVE (the ticket's, and every other choice follows it):
// every sort and filter key must be computable AT ANY PLUS-STATE by a PURE MAP over the rows —
// `rows.map((r) => scaleGearRow(r, state))` — never by rebuilding the index. So the row carries a
// NUMERIC BASE VECTOR (`stats`) rather than the item's stat-block text, and `gearScale.ts` maps
// that vector through phase 0's own rules (src/shared/itemUpgrade.ts). Rebuilding 6,814 rows out
// of the 8.6 MB corpus per slider tick is the thing this shape makes impossible.
//
// WHAT A ROW IS NOT. It is a SEARCH index, not an item card: the full stat block, the flags prose,
// the recipes and the drop story already have a door (`IPC.itemsLookup` → `ItemKnowledge`, which
// the ItemWindow already draws). So a value the vector cannot read as a number is COUNTED in the
// build census (`GearBuildStats`) rather than carried as text — law 1 is satisfied by the census
// making the omission visible and test-pinnable, not by every row dragging its own prose around.
//
// THE STAT VOCABULARY IS CLOSED AND MEASURED (census over the committed corpus, 2026-08-13, the
// 2026-08-05 scrape — 11,161 distinct pages). The stat/save keys the corpus states, by frequency:
//   STR 1741 · HP 1375 · WIS 1341 · MANA 1282 · SV MAGIC 1279 · STA 1244 · INT 1199 · DEX 1086 ·
//   SV FIRE 1045 · SV COLD 1042 · AGI 952 · SV DISEASE 951 · SV POISON 949 · CHA 897 ·
//   CHARGES 443 · HASTE 64 · END 30 · COOLDOWN 9 · CAST TIME 5 · REQUIRED LEVEL 5 · REGEN 5 ·
//   SV VOID 2 · ATTACK 1 · MANA REGEN 1
// plus the structural numeric fields `parseStatsBlock` keys separately: AC 4600, WT 11143,
// DMG/Atk Delay 1709, Dmg Bon, Backstab, Range 212.
// `GEAR_STAT_KEYS` is the COMPARISON subset of that census — the keys a player sorts and
// threshold-filters gear by. CHARGES / COOLDOWN / CAST TIME / REQUIRED LEVEL are deliberately out:
// they are per-item facts, not gear comparisons, and a "sort by charges" column would rank six
// hundred items by a field twenty of them state. Every key left out is COUNTED by key in
// `GearBuildStats.unindexedStatKeys`, and `tests/gearIndex.test.mts` pins that census — so a
// rescrape that invents a stat spelling turns the suite red instead of silently dropping a column.
//
// KEYS ARE `itemUpgrade.normalizeStatKey`'s SPELLING, not the corpus's: MANA → MP, REGEN →
// HP_REGEN, ENDURANCE → END. That is not a preference — it is the vocabulary phase 0's
// `upgradeStatClass` dispatches on, and a vector keyed any other way could not be scaled without
// re-stating the alias table (which this file, like effectIndex.ts, never does).
