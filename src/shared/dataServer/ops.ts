// own, because the op of the REQUEST whose id it names is what decides the result shape (a reply
// that repeated its own op would be a second place for the two to disagree). That rule is not
// expressible in the generated types — `ReplyResult` is a bare union there — so this file is where
// it becomes one, and `OpsAreExhaustive` makes a new op in `protocol/schema/` a compile error here
// until somebody writes down what it answers with.
//
// PARAMS ARE DERIVED, NEVER RESTATED. `ParamsFor` reads them straight off the wire union, so only
// the result side of the registry can drift at all.

  // others by value alone.
  'resist.levels': ResistLevelsResult
  // THE CLIENT'S OWN SPELL TABLE, PER SPELL (boundary verdict 7, JOS-497 item 3). A `resist.*` op
  // rather than an extension of `knowledge.spell` because the two answer about different SOURCES:
  // that one serves the committed wiki scrape with removals, corrections and derived durations
  // applied, and this serves Daybreak's `spells_us.txt`. A caller asking "how is this resisted" and
  // one asking "what does the wiki say" must be able to tell which answered, and one merged record
  // would make that unanswerable from the value — the same argument that keeps the five `*.define`
  // ops five entries.
  'resist.spell': ResistSpellResult
  // THE SAME TABLE, ASKED A DIFFERENT KIND OF QUESTION (JOS-507). `resist.spell` answers about ONE
  // spell's mechanics; this answers about the table as a CATALOGUE — what exists, filed under what,
  // learnable by whom and when. It is a `spells.*` op rather than a third `resist.*` one for that
  // reason, and it is not `knowledge.search`, which ranks the committed wiki scrape and knows
  // nothing about the client's categories at all. Its own shape, because a windowed list with facets
  // beside it shares no field with any of the three.
  'spells.search': SpellsSearchResult
  // LOG DISCOVERY (owner ruling 21, decision sheet 1a — JOS-498). A COMMAND AND A QUERY, and the
  // command answers with the ack six ops already share: `logs.setDir` pushes one directory, which is
  // not a list, so there is nothing per-family to report back and `DefineAck` is exactly right. It
  // is written down as its own entry for the reason every shared shape here is — five ops that agree
