/**
 * The spawnable overlay window KINDS (Task #54 — overlay v2; 'events' added in Task #59):
 *   - 'fight'   : the CURRENT-fight meter + a FIGHT selector (recent encounters).
 *   - 'overall' : the ZONE meter + a ZONE-session selector.
 *   - 'events'  : the EVENT LOG — a live reverse-chronological feed of alerts firing,
 *                 notable loot, and quest completions (see FeedEvent below).
 *   - 'heal-fight' / 'heal-overall' (Task #59): the HEALING pair — the same two selection
 *                 semantics as the damage pair ('heal-fight' = current encounter, 'heal-overall'
 *                 = zone session), rendering `SegmentView.healing` instead of the damage bars.
 *   - 'toast' (docs/plans/celebration-toasts.md): the CELEBRATION strip — normally renders
 *                 nothing; a boss kill or a Sky quest completion animates a card in, holds, and
 *                 leaves. Not a meter: it has no selector, no drill and no scope.
 *   - 'buffs' / 'debuffs' (JOS-89, split in JOS-119; docs/plans/buff-timer-overlay.md): the
 *                 BUFF/TIMER bars, as TWO windows over ONE model. 'buffs' draws the beneficial
 *                 spells you have running (on yourself, on your pet, on whoever you buffed);
 *                 'debuffs' draws what you have put ON something else — debuffs and the
 *                 per-enemy crowd-control clocks (mez and slow ARE debuffs, owner ruling), so a
 *                 chain-mez shows a named countdown per enemy. They are two SURFACES, not two
 *                 models: both hydrate the same `buffs` + `buffTimers` modules and both project
 *                 through `shared/buffTimers.ts buildTimerRows`; the only difference is which
 *                 rows each one keeps (`overlayShowsRow`). Both ship DEFAULT OFF — JOS-89's
 *                 internal-validation stance continues. Neither has a selector or a drill, and
 *                 both obey one law: a duration spells.json STATES counts down, a duration
 *                 nobody states counts UP.
 *   - 'xp' (JOS-195): the PROGRESS read, floating — how fast the bar is moving, when it lands,
 *                 and motes per hour by type, over the app-wide slice (shared/timeslice.ts) with
 *                 `session` as its own default. It derives nothing: every number is the Leveling
 *                 tab's, through `renderer/overlay/xpRows.ts`. Ships DEFAULT OFF like the timer
 *                 windows. Its only configurability is a ROW CHECKLIST (`OverlayConfig.xpRows`) —
 *                 no widget builder, by owner scope.
 *   - 'alertBanner' (JOS-378): the ALERT BANNER — big text where your eyes are, for the alerts
 *                 you marked "Show on screen". Built on the celebration toast's queue machinery
 *                 (the generic half now lives in renderer/overlay/cardQueue.ts) but a SEPARATE
 *                 kind on purpose: the celebration strip sits at the top of the screen and this
 *                 belongs in the upper third where you are already looking, and the two must be
 *                 positioned, sized, held and locked independently. Ships DEFAULT OFF (owner
 *                 ruling, 2026-08-15) — it is text over the game nobody asked for until they do.
 *                 Its own knobs (hold, max lines, introduced) live in shared/alertBanner.ts.
 *   - 'conCard' (JOS-383): the CON CARD — one tooltip-shaped card at the top centre of the screen
 *                 when you `/con` a creature: its level, its zone, its five resist chips, its top
 *                 drops and its respawn. A STRIP like the two above (empty and click-through at
 *                 rest, its own queue of exactly one card), and the FIRST of the three to ship ON
 *                 (owner, 2026-08-16) — it answers a question the player just asked by typing
 *                 `/con`, which is what makes it different from text nobody asked for. Its one knob
 *                 (the auto-hide, 0 = never) lives in shared/conCard.ts.
 * Each kind has its own independently-persisted OverlayConfig (bounds/alpha/lock/text size/drill)
 * and can be open simultaneously. IPC channels + the store are keyed by this.
 *
 * APPEND NEW KINDS AT THE END. `overlayLayout.ts` derives a kind's reserved dock slot from its
 * INDEX here and `tests/overlayLayout.test.mts` pins the exact bounds of slots 0–2, so inserting
 * in the middle moves somebody's window. The SEVENTH meter kind ('debuffs') is the one this note
 * used to warn about: on a 1366×728 laptop seven uniform 380×320 slots cannot be laid out without
 * a column landing on its neighbour. That is now answered in `overlayLayout.ts` — the uniform size
 * SHRINKS (uniformly, all kinds together) on a display that cannot hold the full reserved grid —
 * rather than by silently overlapping two windows. The EIGHTH ('xp') is the first kind to arrive
 * after that machinery existed, and it absorbed it exactly as promised: MEASURED in
 * tests/overlayLayout.test.mts, 1080p and up still seat all eight reserved slots at 380×320 and
 * the small laptop shrinks one rung further rather than overlapping anything.
 *
 * The NINTH ('respawn', JOS-194) is appended on the same terms and needed no geometry code at
 * all — but it did MOVE a rung, and the measurement is recorded rather than glossed: 1080p and
 * 1440p still seat all nine at 380x320, while a 1920x960 work area (80 px shorter than 1080p with
 * a taskbar, which costs it a third row) drops to 323x272 and seats fifteen. `meterSize` chose
 * that on its own, which is the whole point of deriving the layout instead of tabulating it.
 * tests/overlayLayout.test.mts pins both halves.
