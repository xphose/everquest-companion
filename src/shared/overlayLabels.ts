// overlayLabels.ts — WHAT THE APP CALLS EACH OVERLAY WINDOW, in one map (JOS-405).
//
// There were TWO of these and they disagreed. The title bar's Overlay menu said `Zone meter` and
// `Event log`; `shared/shareMerge.ts` said `Overall meter` and `Event feed` — so an imported
// settings bundle offered to change the opacity of a window whose name appeared nowhere in the
// menu the user opens to find it. Neither spelling was wrong; having two was.
//
// THE MENU'S WORDING WINS, because it is the one a user reads before they read any other: it is
// what they clicked to make the window exist. The three kinds that are NOT in that menu (the
// celebration toast, the alert banner, and — for this list's purposes — the mob card) are named
// here in the same voice.
//
// WHY ITS OWN FILE. `shared/types.ts` owns `OverlayKind` and is at the 400-code-line factoring
// ceiling (JOS-140's ruling, restated by this ticket's brief), and a label map is display
// vocabulary rather than a type. It imports nothing but the kind union, so a node test, the
// MUI-free overlay bundle and main can all read it.
