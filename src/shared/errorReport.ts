// ERROR REPORT — the message redactor, the stack parser, and the fingerprint.
// ============================================================================
//
// The three pure functions behind `errorReport` (JOS-100). They sit BESIDE `sanitizeText.ts`
// because they are the same kind of thing: the one definition of how a hostile-by-accident
// string is made safe to carry, run on the client before a byte leaves the machine AND on the
// server before a byte is stored.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL — and what changed about the privacy promise.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every other telemetry field is a member of a closed enum or a bucket index, and TELEMETRY.md
// could therefore say "there is no free-text field anywhere in it". An error report cannot be
// built that way and still be worth having: the whole value of one is the part that is
// SPECIFIC — which error, thrown where, after what. So the owner's ruling (JOS-100) is to
// prioritise DIAGNOSABILITY over pure anonymity, holding ONE bright line:
//
//     GAMEPLAY DATA — log lines, chat, character names — NEVER RIDES AUTOMATICALLY.
//
// That line is held by SHAPE, not by discipline. An error report can carry a redacted message,
// a stack of BUNDLE-RELATIVE frames, and a list of parser event KINDS. There is no field on it
// that a zone, a mob, a spell, an item, a character or a line of log could travel in — the
// frames name files in `out/`, the breadcrumbs are enum members, and the message is the OUTPUT
// of `redactMessage` (below), re-run and re-checked at the server.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE REDACTOR IS NEW, AND THE BRIEF'S PREMISE THAT IT COULD BE REUSED WAS WRONG.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `src/shared/logScrub.ts` is a DROP LIST — it decides whether a whole log line survives, and
// its own law is "never rewrite a line with a placeholder" (a rewritten line still parses into
// a fake event). It has no path/quote/number patterns to borrow, and borrowing its posture
// would be wrong here anyway: a message is not a log line, and dropping it entirely is exactly
// the outcome this feature exists to avoid. So the patterns below are written fresh, and they
// are the FIRST placeholder-substituting redactor in this repo.
//
// PURE: the only import is `./sanitizeText` (itself import-free). No `node:`, no Electron, no
// DOM. It compiles under both tsconfigs and bundles into the telemetry Lambda.

import { sanitizeOneLine } from './sanitizeText'

// ---------------------------------------------------------------- the bounds
//
// Declared FIRST because two of them are default arguments below, and a reader looking for
// "how long may a message be" should not have to scroll past the regex that produces it.
// Each is restated as a wire bound in `./telemetry.ts`; `tests/errorReportContract.test.mts`
// pins the two copies equal, the same way the overlay-kind list is pinned.

/**
 * A FILESYSTEM PATH. Three arms, and the shape of each was decided by a failing test rather
 * than by taste — the first draft of this regex stopped at the first SPACE, and the suite
 * immediately produced `Cannot find module <path> Legends\Logs` out of a real UNC share.
 * Windows paths contain spaces constantly (`C:\Program Files\…`, and this game's own install
 * directory is `EverQuest Legends`), so a space-terminated path pattern leaks the tail of every
 * one of them.
 *
 *   1. WINDOWS, drive-letter or UNC. After the prefix it consumes SEGMENT-BY-SEGMENT: any run
 *      of characters — spaces included — that ends in a separator, repeated, then one final
 *      segment with no spaces in it. So `C:\Program Files\eqc\out\a.js` goes whole, while
 *      `seek to C:\a\b failed after 3 retries` gives up the path and keeps the sentence: the
 *      loop cannot take ` failed after 3 retries` because there is no separator after it.
 *   2. POSIX HOME DIRECTORIES BY NAME (`/Users/<user>`, `/home/<user>`, `/root/...`), consumed to the end
 *      of the run. This arm exists because arm 3 cannot cover `/Users/<user>` — two segments,
 *      structurally identical to `/v1/telemetry` — and `/Users/<user>` is precisely where a
 *      person's name lives. Naming the three directories is the only non-guessing way to tell
 *      those two apart.
 *   3. POSIX, GENERIC: at least three segments (`/usr/lib/node_modules/x`). Two segments are
 *      deliberately left alone — a URL path (`POST /v1/telemetry failed`) looks exactly like
 *      one, and eating it would cost the diagnosable half of a message to cover a shape arm 2
 *      already covers where it matters.
 *
 * NONE of the arms can match the placeholder they produce (`<path>` has no separator and no
 * drive letter), which is half of why `redactMessage` is idempotent.
 *
 * OVER-REDACTION IS THE SAFE DIRECTION AND IS TAKEN DELIBERATELY: two paths in one sentence can
 * be swallowed as one match. Losing a few words of a message is a cost; publishing a fragment
 * of somebody's home directory is a broken promise.

 *   4. QUOTED STRINGS, unwrapping a quoted placeholder rather than swallowing it.

 *   6. COLLAPSE RUNS OF SPACES and trim — a redaction leaves gaps behind, and two messages
 *      that differ only in how much whitespace the redaction left are the same message.
 *   7. CAP, LAST. Capping before redacting would break idempotence: a cut could leave half a
 *      path (`C:\Users\<user>`) that the next pass would redact, so the second run would not equal
 *      the first. Cutting AFTER the placeholders are in place cannot create a new match —
