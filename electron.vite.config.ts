    // gated on `!app.isPackaged`.

    // MEASURED, not assumed: without this line rollup follows that dynamic import and bundles
    // both SDKs into out/main/chunks (917 kB across 23 chunks, one of them 647 kB), and since
    // electron-builder packages `out/**` wholesale, every shipped installer would carry the
    // AWS SDK and a postgres driver as dead weight — and the dev gate would be the ONLY thing
    // standing between a shipped build and a working backlog client. Externalized, the emitted
    // chunk is ~10 kB of our own code whose `require("pg")` / `require("@aws-sdk/…")` CANNOT
    // resolve in a packaged app, because electron-builder never installs devDependencies.
