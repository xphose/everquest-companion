# AGENTS.md — EQ Legends Companion

Distilled operating manual. Per-task history lives in `git log` and Linear;
this file holds only repeatable rules and load-bearing design. Long-form war
stories were MOVED verbatim to `docs/agents-archive.md` (JOS-252) — a cut
that proves load-bearing is reversible in one paste — and
`tests/agentsDoc.test.mts` enforces a 20k-word ceiling here. Distillation
protocol: done carefully by the integrator, never delegated to a worker,
never mechanical truncation, archive before cutting.

## What this is

Electron (electron-vite) + TS + React + MUI desktop app that tails the
**EverQuest Legends** log in real time. Surfaces: an Overview landing tab
(default view), Plane of Sky quest tracking, loot, inventory reconcile,
leveling/AA analytics, a Maps tab, class-combo inference with user
corrections, proc analytics, raid targets, buffs simulation, alerts with
sounds + rank-upgrade intelligence, a Details-style DPS meter with
drill-down/timeline, floating overlay meters, an EXALTATIONS tab (the
Exaltation/BiS planner — labelled Exaltations since JOS-42; the `planner`
view id, route, store keys and `planner-*` testids are unchanged —
docs/plans/exaltation-planner.md), celebration toasts
(docs/plans/celebration-toasts.md), and a TIMERS tab + overlay (JOS-194 —
law 13 below). Committed knowledge DBs: mobs (7.9k), items (11.2k incl.
dropsfrom + eraTag), spells (2.0k), classes, zones (era-annotated), wiki
respawn floors (507 rows, 394 readable). First stable release v0.2.0
(2026-08-03); per-release history lives in `shared/releaseNotes.ts` and the
archive. Layout: `src/main` (Node), `src/preload`, `src/renderer`,
`src/shared`, `tests/`, `scripts/`. Per-surface detail:
docs/agents-archive.md.

- Repo: `C:\Users\<user>\everquest-companion` (public: github.com/jmoyers/everquest-companion).
- Game log: `C:\Users\Public\Daybreak Game Company\Installed Games\EverQuest
  Legends\Logs\eqlog_<Char>_<server>.txt` — but the path is auto-discovered +
  Settings-overridable now; NEVER hardcode, route through
  `config.ts effectiveEqRoot()/eqLogsDir()`.
- Active dev character: `Primitive@freeport`. The log is LIVE and growing.

## Operating model (how work happens here — this works, keep it)

- **Roles: Fable plans, Opus does — and that includes SUBAGENT dispatch
  (user rule, 2026-08-03).** The main session (Fable) is the integrator /
  designer / thinker: it diagnoses, designs, writes precise briefs,
  dispatches parallel Opus executor agents with DISJOINT file ownership,
  reviews their reports, runs the verification gauntlet, and commits per
  wave. Design/planning work is Fable's own job, never delegated to Opus
  planning agents; Opus subagents get concrete implementation briefs only
  (read-only research subagents are fine). Executors do the work and report
  honestly — including when the brief is WRONG: an executor overturning the
  integrator's assumption with evidence is a feature, not insubordination
  (it has corrected real briefing errors — docs/agents-archive.md).
- **Work ships in WAVES.** 1–5 agents in parallel, then integrate → verify
  (typecheck + lint + full unit suite + e2e when main/renderer changed) →
  commit with a detailed message. Big projects (the lint campaign) are
  partitioned into disjoint waves with per-wave regression gates and run
  until done. The user gets a short "In flight / Settled" readout whenever
  a turn ends with agents still running.
- **THE BRIEF IS SIZED TO THE ASK (owner, 2026-08-13).** A cosmetic or
  single-control change gets a NARROW brief: the one surface named, one
  targeted e2e step, explicit permission to skip every suite the change
  cannot touch, and a stated size expectation in the dispatch comment so an
  overrun is visible mid-flight. The full-discipline brief — both-surface
  parity, comment-law rewrites, full unit plus multi-spec e2e — is reserved
  for changes that move laws or data. The law is calibration, not laxity: a
  targeted step catches the same bug on the surface that has it. The measured
  incident (JOS-343, 55 min / 225k tokens for a cosmetic toggle):
  docs/agents-archive.md.
- **THE BOARD IS IN LINEAR, AND THE OWNER STEERS IT (owner, 2026-08-05).**
  Canonical project management is the kanban in the owner's PERSONAL Linear
  workspace (Josh's Maker Space, team JOS — never the work workspace).
  `scripts/linear.mts` is the CLI (auth: `.triage/linear.env`, gitignored).
  The full loop is the `linear-board` skill (.claude/skills/linear-board) —
  the short form: SYNC fresh before every pick (the owner reorders,
  reprioritizes and cancels between reads; a Canceled ticket is a STOP order
  even mid-flight), the ticket IS the brief (`linear.mts show JOS-N`; bodies
  are self-contained build briefs), states are Todo → In Progress → Done
  only (no Backlog), tickets are END-TO-END improvements titled
  `Module / What the user gets`, and In Progress/Done moves carry
  wave-and-commit comments. Only owner-accepted work becomes a ticket.
- **DISPATCH COMMENT AFTER LAUNCH, NEVER BEFORE (owner, 2026-08-13).** Make
  the Agent call, SEE IT SUCCEED, then move the ticket to In Progress and
  write the "Dispatched" comment — never the reverse. Corollary: fleet
  status is reported ONLY from evidence — a spawn result in context, a live
  task, a worktree or branch — never from ticket comments. A "Dispatched"
  comment found without a matching worker gets the ticket corrected (back to
  Todo, honest note) immediately. The three same-day incidents
  (JOS-287/296/297): docs/agents-archive.md.
- **BRANCH INTEGRATION RULES (owner, 2026-08-05 — one merge behavior, not a
  juggle).** Every worker commits on its OWN worktree branch, never on main.
  Before reporting done, the worker makes the branch MERGE-READY: full checks
  green at its tip (typecheck + lint + full unit suite + the e2e specs it
  touched), no stray diagnostics/junctions/tsbuildinfo noise in the tree, and
  — if main has moved under it — rebased onto current main (or explicitly
  reports the conflict it cannot resolve). The integrator then ALWAYS
  integrates by MERGING the worker branch (`git merge --no-ff`), one branch
  at a time, re-verifying on merged main before push, then deletes branch +
  worktree. Cherry-picking is reserved for salvage (a dead agent's WIP), not
  routine integration. Conflicts the merge surfaces are resolved by the
  integrator when small, bounced back to the worker when semantic. The
  destination is a PR model (workers push branches, review happens on the
  PR); these rules are that model minus the forge.
- **Planner/integrator diagnoses against the REAL log first** (grep/sed, or a
  throwaway `scripts/_*.mts` replay via `npx tsx` — delete after). Executors
  get verified findings, not hypotheses. Never write to the game log.
- **Golden-window tests are the law** (`npm test`, node:test + tsx). Any
  "world model looks wrong" report becomes a fixture FIRST: extract the real
  log span (`tests/fixtures/*.log` via `tests/extract-*.mjs`), hand-read it,
  write the expected state, fix until green. Priming fixtures warm learned
  state (classifier/overlay) the way a full replay would.
- **FLAKES ARE TRACKED AND FIXED, regardless of who wrote the test** (owner
  rule, 2026-08-11). A test that fails under load/live conditions and passes
  on re-run is not noise to shrug at — it is either a fragile spec or a real
  race, and both are work. The ledger lives HERE; every observed flake gets a
  row (spec · signature · occurrences · disposition), integrators append on
  sighting, and a flake at 3+ occurrences must have a fix ticket or chip —
  "green on re-run" is a report line, never a resolution. Known rows:
  - `sky-filters.e2e` · remount race · **RESOLVED 9816cd34 (JOS-279)**
    (`tests/e2e/viewRemount.mts` holds the precondition); a SECOND distinct
    cause with the guard holding · 1 sighting 2026-08-13 · watch. Both rows
    at full length: docs/agents-archive.md.
  - `live_surfaces.rs` timer hydration ×1; **RESOLVED 9dbf7ab**. Details: docs/agents-archive.md.
  - `engined tests/perf_snapshot.rs` · `perf.snapshot was refused: Unavailable
    "the fold did not answer within 5000 ms"` from the `until` poll while the
    engine is still loading its spell catalog on a starved CI runner · 1
    sighting (2026-09-04, v1.16.0 tag run, two tests at once; the main-push
    run of the same commit was green) · HARDENED same day: `until` reads that
    one refusal as "not yet" and keeps polling to `PATIENCE`; every other
    refusal still panics.
  - `engined tests/combat.rs` live-meter tests · the fight closes before the
    test's hit lands (`Drop` op where an edit was expected; segment "fight"
    not "current"), plus one harness connect timeout · 1 sighting (2026-09-04,
    v1.16.0 tag engine job, second attempt, three tests; same commit green on
    the main push) · MECHANISM KNOWN: `Staged::line` stamps relative to TEST
    START while closure is judged on the wall clock (`FALLBACK_IDLE_MS` 60 s),
    so a runner that takes over a minute to go live has already idled the
    fight · chip filed: anchor live stamps to go-live.
  - `combat-dashboard.e2e` · narrow-window resize never lands, settleStable
    settles on stale geometry · 6 sightings 2026-08-10→26, including
    STANDALONE (the full-sweep-only pattern is broken) · fix shape diagnosed
    (wait for bounds to differ before settling); ticket JOS-232 filed —
    priority raised.
  - `window-bounds.e2e` · close-time bounds write never lands under sweep
    load ("closing the window writes down where it was left — (none)",
    cascades into both relaunch-bounds checks) · 2 sightings (2026-08-12
    40-spec sweep, JOS-260; 2026-08-13 sweep, JOS-279 — green standalone
    after, both) · load-sensitive persistence-on-close, unrelated to the
    change under test; report line.
  - `respawn-timers.e2e` · two clock reads made the learned gap 181 s where
    four assertions spell `3m 00s` (1 sighting) · **RESOLVED 0572c77f** —
    both deaths stamp off ONE captured `now`; the assertions were never
    widened. Full history: docs/agents-archive.md.
  - MULTI-SPEC SWEEP · six specs die at once mid-click, "Target page … has
    been closed" · 1 sighting (2026-08-13 sweep, JOS-279; six green serially
    after, none in the next sweep) · a host/load event, not one spec's race —
    a second sighting is a runner-concurrency ticket.
  - `engine-boots.e2e` · the clean-shutdown claim failed once under a full
    sweep · 1 sighting (2026-08-26, JOS-501; green standalone ×3 same day) ·
    under concurrent launches the wait for the stdin-close exit is what loses
    a race with the runner's teardown. Report line until a second sighting;
    if it recurs, the suspect is the wait, not the contract.
  - `engined/tests/combat.rs` fixture clock · **RESOLVED JOS-531**: startup
    precedes fixture timestamps. Details: docs/agents-archive.md.
  - `sky-achievements.e2e` counts startup · 1 sighting (2026-09-07) ·
    **RESOLVED a65586c**: await progress within the original deadline.
    Details: docs/agents-archive.md.
  - `presenceWorker.test` first-tick dedup · watches the REAL machine; fails
    while EverQuest runs with a player at the keyboard · 3 sightings
    (2026-08-10 ×2, 2026-08-12 JOS-239 worker mid-session, green on final
    run) · needs hermetics without weakening the once-then-heartbeat pin;
    chip filed — satisfies the 3+ rule via the chip.
  - `perf.e2e` heartbeat boundary · the probe asked about the WRONG window
    (5 sightings, full-sweep only) · **RESOLVED 0523dd90 (JOS-279)** — now
    `probeWindowMs`, plus a three-valued verdict so the naive fix's mirror
    flake cannot appear. Full history: docs/agents-archive.md.
- **Fixtures are COMMITTED and SCRUBBED.** `tests/fixtures/*.log` is tracked
  (a `!tests/fixtures/*.log` negation under the blanket `*.log`), so CI's
  `npm test` runs the FULL suite. The repo is PUBLIC, so every extractor
  MUST route through the shared scrub `tests/fixture-scrub.mjs`
  (`scrubKeep`) — never re-implement a drop list, never hand-copy a raw log
  span into `fixtures/`. Scrub = DROP the line; NEVER rewrite it with a
  placeholder (a rewritten line still parses into a fake event and would
  pollute the golden expectation). It drops third-party chat/social: all
  quoted speech (mob speech included — nothing parses it), `/who` output,
  group join/leave/invite/leader lines, and social emotes. It KEEPS combat,
  casts, buff landings/wear-offs, loot, turn-ins, zone lines, level-ups, AA,
  charm/pet lines and system messages.
  **CARVE-OUT: the pet-claim tell** `<Name> told you, '… Master.'` IS a tell
  but is spoken by an NPC pet and is the strongest binding signal for a
  summoned pet (law below), so it is kept verbatim — dropping it silently
  unbinds every pet in every combat fixture.
  **CARVE-OUT: the six pet-voiced SAYS** (JOS-47) — the six exact sentences
  in `shared/logScrub.ts PET_SAY_LINES`, matched as EXACT SENTENCES, never as
  a `/Master/` pattern (a loose pattern leaks mob flavor). Same argument as
  the tell: an NPC's words under an NPC's name. They prove the speaker is
  somebody's pet — NOT that it is YOURS (JOS-49). The carve-out STAYS; the
  six still parse into `petSay`. Full argument: docs/agents-archive.md.
  **CARVE-OUT: the `/pet who leader` answer** (JOS-52) — `<Name> says, 'My
  leader is <anyone>.'`, EXACT shape, never a `/leader/` pattern. It was
  SELF-GATED until **JOS-270** (owner ruling 2026-08-13): THE GATE IS GONE —
  the line is kept whatever name it carries, on the 2026-08-05
  group-membership reasoning (a structural fact about the fight, and both
  names already appear uncensored in every combat line of the same slice);
  the gate had made a live report structurally un-triageable while no
  committed fixture ever contained the line. Gate history:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
  The user's OWN `/who` row (Primitive) is likewise exempt — it is the only
  line stating the class loadout. Bystanders' NAMES survive in mechanical
  lines (kill credit, fizzle/interrupt, third-person buff-landing emotes):
  load-bearing, and they carry no one's words. Full argument:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
  **A REPORTER'S SLICE NEVER BECOMES A FIXTURE** (.gitignore `.triage/`: those
  slices are a user's own game log and never enter git). When a defect exists
  only in someone else's log, the window stays the OWNER's real bytes and the
  ONE sentence his log lacks is INJECTED as a parsed event in the test —
  quoted verbatim from the slice, cited by report id, with the mob's name
  swapped. petClaimWindows (the `… Master.'` tell) set the precedent;
  mobLifetapPlayer (JOS-48) is the case that needed it. Never hand-author a
  shape no real log has printed, and say in the header which line is injected.
- **Headless app test** (`npm run test:e2e`, playwright-core `_electron`):
  drives the REAL app end-to-end and asserts what the user SEES — use it for
  anything a fixture replay can't see (layout, mount/empty states,
  hydration). `EQ_E2E=1` (src/main/e2e.ts) is the whole test mode: no window
  ever shown, the single-instance lock skipped, userData in a temp dir before
  electron-store loads — invisible while the user plays. Builds into
  `out-e2e/` (ABSOLUTE `--outDir`; a relative one buries the renderer) so it
  never races the dev watcher; DOM + screenshot land in
  `tests/e2e/artifacts/` on failure.
- **THE E2E INPUT IS A COMMITTED FIXTURE, AND THE HARNESS PLAYS THE LIVE HALF**
  (JOS-29, wave E2 — docs/plans/e2e-parallel.md). `tests/e2e/logFixture.mts`
  stages a throwaway EQ install per launch and hands it over with
  `EQ_INSTALL_DIR` — the product knows nothing about it. Cut fixtures with
  `npm run fixtures:e2e` (through the shared scrub, like every extractor).
  Because the harness OWNS the copy it can PLAY: `appendAt()` writes
  EQ-stamped lines into the tailed file and they travel the real path;
  `tests/e2e/gameplay.mts` scripts a pull whose damage this repo STATES, so
  assertions are EXACT. Map PACKS stay a game install (junctioned in).
  Frozen numbers still rot for anything the fixture does not fix.
- **WAIT FOR THE CONDITION, NEVER FOR THE CLOCK** (wave E3).
  `tests/e2e/settle.mts` is the vocabulary: `settle(read, ok)`,
  `settleCount`, `settleGone`, and `settleStable` — which is how an ABSENCE
  is asserted. Two raw sleeps survive in the whole suite and both are
  instruments rather than bets. Two measured traps: `requestAnimationFrame`
  can be throttled to nothing in a never-composited window (`nextFrames`
  races a timer), and `hoverAt` must clip against every CLIPPING ANCESTOR
  and verify with `elementFromPoint` — that was the leveling red, for weeks.
- **Frozen numbers rot**: the live log grows, so full-log assertions must be
  identities (`earned == allocated + unspent`), monotonic floors, or
  anchor-independent invariants — never `== <today's count>`.
  **AND A RATIO ROTS TOO, IF ITS DENOMINATOR IS THE OWNER'S PLAY** (JOS-234):
  the kill/exp join's `joined / credited kills > 0.9` went deterministically
  red when the character hit the level cap — a grey kill prints no experience
  line to join. Before freezing a rate, ask which side the code controls and
  CONDITION the denominator on the code's own precondition; then say it again
  over the most RECENT slice, or old rows dilute a fresh regression.
  tests/progressionKillJoin.test.mts carries the worked example; full story:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
- **Regression gates**: model refactors prove untouched dimensions
  byte-identical (taxonomy added categories; total damage stayed exact).
  Run baseline before changing, diff after.
- **Concurrent agents**: disjoint file ownership; re-read shared files
  (index.ts, ipc.ts, types.ts, preload, App.tsx) immediately before each
  surgical edit. errors.log noise from mid-edit HMR is normal — judge by
  final typecheck/tests and check timestamps before blaming current code.
- **PATH-SCOPED COMMITS (integrator law, learned the hard way 2026-08-03).**
  While waves overlap, the integrator stages EXPLICIT file lists from the
  finished agent's report — never `git add <dir>` and never
  `git add tests/fixtures` (broad adds swept in-flight files three times in
  one day). After any commit touching shared hot files, sanity-check that
  HEAD is self-consistent; a follow-up commit says "completes <sha>" when it
  repairs one of these.
- **Mid-flight course changes go BY MESSAGE to the owning agent** — never by
  dispatching a second agent into owned files, and never by the integrator
  editing them. An agent that stops "to wait" for its own e2e run is
  STOPPED — a message resumes it; don't ping-pong twice, finish its
  integration yourself from `git status` + its interim report. Stories:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
- **Wave choreography, distilled 2026-08-05 (25-wave session; commit
  specifics: docs/agents-archive.md):**
  - A file carrying TWO waves' hunks lands with the LATER wave's commit +
    a "completes <sha>" note. Never `git add -p` a shared hot file into
    halves.
  - `git status --porcelain | grep '^[MADR] '` BEFORE every commit — the
    index is shared and a sibling's staged deletion WILL ride your commit.
  - **e2e runs PARALLEL and from a worktree** (wave E1,
    docs/plans/e2e-parallel.md). The isolation unit is ONE LAUNCH — a
    `mkdtempSync` userData dir per `launchApp()`, artifacts under
    `artifacts/<runId>/<spec>/` — so the old single-flight law is retired.
    The runner discovers `*.e2e.mts`, takes a name filter, caps each spec
    at 5 min, writes `artifacts/<runId>/summary.json`; `--serial` remains
    for debugging. `node_modules` is resolved, not joined, so a worktree
    with no install runs the suite. Measured runs: docs/agents-archive.md.
  - **The awaiting-sample law generalizes**: no file format, log
    annotation, or era claim ships from imagination — outputs kinds refuse
    typed until a real fixture graduates them; Double Bow Shot waits for a
    bow log; era waited for zones. "Structurally covered" ≠ verified —
    say which.
- **Feedback triage loop** (proven 2026-08-05, three same-day turnarounds):
  report → integrator diagnoses against the REAL log/slice FIRST (a slice
  may prove more than the prose) → wave → stamp `triaged` with an honest
  note via `triage-feedback set`. Stories: docs/agents-archive.md.
- **Product lens (owner, 2026-08-05): deepen existing surfaces by
  default; net-new surface area gets the suspicion test — fits the
  real-time companion vision? achievable live from the log? or
  performative? (Faction tracking parked by exactly this test; the
  outputs ENGINE shipped surface-free instead.)
- **During parallel waves, red is ambient; final reports are the truth.**
  Executors report other agents' failures SEPARATELY from their own. eslint's
  cache lies after cross-agent deletes (errors past a file's length mean
  `rm -rf node_modules/.cache/eslint`, not code); a throwaway
  `scripts/_*.mts` left behind breaks `typecheck:node` for everyone — delete
  before reporting.
- **Plans go stale while agents fly.** Line ranges, counts and tables in a
  design doc describe planning time — executors re-derive them fresh and
  treat every measured claim as re-checkable (~20 briefing errors overturned
  by executor measurement, zero wrongly). Reward the overturn, then encode
  what it taught.
- **KEEP THE TREE BUILDABLE (user rule, 2026-08-03): the dev app must not
  stay down.** Transient seconds-long HMR breakage is fine; MINUTES is not.
  Concretely: create any file you import (even an empty stub) BEFORE writing
  the import — a scrape/codegen that produces a data file gets a stub first
  and overwrites it when done; sequence multi-file changes so `npm run dev`
  keeps compiling between edits; if you must break main's build, fix it in
  your very next edit, not at wave end.
- Commits: integrator commits per wave, detailed messages,
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude`. Keep `npm run dev` (watch) running — main edits
  auto-relaunch, renderer edits HMR.

- A native .node binding resolves its DLL imports from ITS OWN directory before
  System32 (measured via process.report sharedObjects, JOS-274) - app-local CRT
  placement goes beside the binding, never on PATH (PATH loses to System32 and
  mixes runtime generations).

## Toolchain gotchas

- Node/git/gh NOT on PATH in fresh shells: prepend `C:\Program Files\nodejs`,
  `C:\Program Files\git\bin`, `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI`.
- NO RAW CONTROL BYTES IN SOURCE FILES — spell escapes out (`\u0000`, not a
  literal NUL). A NUL as a "collision-proof key separator" is a fine idea and
  has now been written as a raw byte twice (JOS-133, JOS-150); git classifies
  the file as binary, diffs/blame/grep go dark, and the integrator has to
  respell it. Same runtime value either way, so there is no reason to ever
  emit the byte.
- Backticked EQ names (`Innoruuk\`s Chosen`) break inline `node -e` — use
  temp script files.
- Errors harness: main+renderer errors append to `<userData>/errors.log` AND
  dev stdout, grep `[everquest-companion:error]` (source tags:
  `main:uncaughtException`, `renderer:ErrorBoundary`, …). `<userData>` is
  PER CHANNEL (below) — a dev-app error is in
  `%APPDATA%\everquest-companion-dev\errors.log`, the installed app's in
  `%APPDATA%\everquest-companion\errors.log`. Info logs use the
  `[everquest-companion]` prefix. ErrorBoundary prevents blank windows. Check
  it first when anything's weird.
- `npm run typecheck` (node+web) before done. Data JSONs (spells, overlay
  baseline) are ES-imported so electron-vite INLINES them — a path-relative
  readFile would miss in `out/main/`.
- TS: discriminated unions with union-typed tags need a single-guard
  narrowing (`if (ev.t !== 'dmg') return`); `@shared/*` value imports need
  the renderer `resolve.alias` in electron.vite.config.ts. Node-tested
  pure modules use RELATIVE value imports (type-only may keep the alias) —
  the mobSearch.ts precedent, now repo-wide.
- Vite 5 inlines JSON as PRETTY-PRINTED object literals unless
  `json: { stringify: true }` — measured 1.56× bundle bloat on items.json
  before the flag. Keep it set for the main bundle.
- Blink scrollbars: setting the STANDARD props (`scrollbar-width`/
  `scrollbar-color`) switches to native Fluent bars and SILENTLY IGNORES
  every `::-webkit-scrollbar-*` rule — the two are mutually exclusive.
  The themed inset scrollbar lives in theme.ts + overlay.html (values
  must move together; the overlay is MUI-free and can't import tokens).
- `flexWrap` converts content overflow into HEIGHT — a "compact bar"
  contract means `nowrap` + one shrinkable/ellipsizing group for
  world-supplied text (tooltips keep the facts); controls never shrink.
- Chromium `navigator.clipboard` needs a permission this app denies
  wholesale — clipboard writes route over IPC to main's clipboard API.
- **A dynamic `import()` is BUNDLED, not externalized** — "it's a devDep so
  production can't load it" is FALSE by default: the triage tab's first
  build shipped 917 kB of working AWS SDK into `out/main` with only a
  boolean guarding it. Dev-only main-process code must ALSO be listed in
  `externalizeDepsPlugin({ include })` so the emitted chunk carries bare
  unresolvable `require`s. Measure the built output; never trust the
  dependency graph's intuition.
- **Never reference a vite `define` bare**, and **anchor a dev-only flag on
  `import.meta.env.DEV`, not on the `define`.** Defines exist only from
  dev-server START, so a bare identifier under a stale server is a
  `ReferenceError` that blanks the whole app — and feature-hidden is still a
  SILENT wrong answer. ONE guarded reader per flag:
  `import.meta.env.DEV && (typeof __X__ === 'undefined' || __X__)` — absent
  define means STALE SERVER, degrade upward — and log the resolved value once
  at boot. Config changes (defines, entries, externals) require the OWNER to
  restart `npm run dev`; say so in the report. Full story:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
- **OWNER tooling needs `EQ_OWNER_TOOLS=1`; plain DEV is not enough** (JOS-72).
  Tier 1 (dev restart, `UNRELEASED`, boot diagnostics) stays on plain
  `import.meta.env.DEV`; tier 2 (the Triage tab + every `triage:*` handler,
  which read the owner's DSQL/S3/CloudWatch) additionally requires the env
  var at BOTH ends — main refuses to register the IPC
  (`src/main/ownerTools.ts`) and the renderer hides the nav row. Tier 2
  degrades **CLOSED** — the opposite of tier 1's degrade-upward; policy in
  `src/shared/ownerTools.ts`. The owner sets it in the SHELL
  (`setx EQ_OWNER_TOOLS 1`). Never commit it, never put an AWS profile name
  in the gate. Full story: docs/agents-archive.md.
- MediaWiki: anonymous `eilimit` caps at 500; >50 pageids per revisions
  batch returns HTTP 200 with ZERO pages and no warning — BATCH=50 is
  measured, not tunable.
- **`setTimeout(n)` IN THE MAIN PROCESS DOES NOT LAST n ms** (MEASURED
  2026-08-06): Windows runs a 15.6 ms timer quantum, so a sleep ends at the
  next TICK EDGE after the time requested and a work/rest cycle SNAPS TO THE
  GRID — no fixed argument buys an arbitrary duty. Anything pacing itself
  with a timer must MEASURE what it got and bookkeep the difference
  (the deleted `replaySlicer.ts`'s debt ledger was the pattern), never trust the nominal
  argument; `setImmediate` is not a pause at all. Measurements:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
- **`setFocusable` IS NOT AN ATTRIBUTE WRITE ON WINDOWS — IT MOVES THE
  FOREGROUND WINDOW** (JOS-199). `setFocusable(false)` DEACTIVATES the
  window, and Chromium's deactivate `SetForegroundWindow`s the first visible
  window below it — under an always-on-top overlay, that is EverQuest. The
  call is not idempotent and must never be "re-asserted": focusability is a
  WINDOW STYLE (WS_EX_NOACTIVATE) and survives hide/show, so set it in the
  CONSTRUCTOR (`focusable:`) and afterwards only when `isFocusable()`
  disagrees. `tests/overlayFocusPolicy.test.mts` pins the one call site.

## Linting (ESLint 9 flat config + the ratchet)

`npm run lint` gates CI in BOTH build.yml jobs, right after typecheck. Full
rationale lives in the header of `eslint.config.mjs` — read it before touching a
threshold. The short version:

- **Two layers.** Correctness: typescript-eslint `strictTypeChecked` +
  `stylisticTypeChecked`, type-aware through TS's project service (lint and
  typecheck can never see different file sets), plus react-hooks for the
  renderer. Factoring: `complexity 12`, `max-depth 3`, `max-lines 400`,
  `max-lines-per-function 100`, `max-params 4` (line counts skip blanks AND
  comments — the metric is code mass).
- **Those five numbers were MEASURED, not guessed.** `npm run lint:measure`
  re-runs ESLint with the rules pinned to `max: 0` and prints the
  distribution + a threshold sweep; each threshold sits between p95 and p99
  of the real tree. Never change one without re-running it.
- **THE RATCHET ONLY SHRINKS.** `eslint.ratchet.mjs` is a GENERATED per-file
  rule-off block listing exactly today's violations, so lint is green with zero
  source changes. It is a debt register, not a permission slip. A wave DELETES the
  entries it fixed and re-runs `npm run lint` to prove the deletion was earned.
  **Adding an entry is the integrator's call, never an executor's**, and
  regenerating wholesale (`npm run lint:ratchet`) to make a red build green
  silently widens it and defeats the whole design. `EQ_LINT_NO_RATCHET=1 npx
  eslint .` shows the true state.
- **THE ENGINE HAS THE SAME BARS, RATCHETED (JOS-523).** `npm run
  check:rust-factoring` measures every `engine/crates` source against
  complexity 12 / 400 code lines per file / 100 per function, frozen at
  today's debt by `engine/factoring-baseline.json` (only-ever-shrinks; fix
  then `-- --write` in the same commit). Counting rules in
  `scripts/rustFactoring.mts`; runs in CI's engine job. The burn-down is
  JOS-525.
- **Refactor-wave law.** `lint-worklist.md` (generated beside the ratchet)
  partitions the inventory into five disjoint waves so agents run in
  parallel on non-overlapping files. Every wave is **BEHAVIOR-PRESERVING
  ONLY**: no fixes, no "while I was in here". Full `npm run typecheck` +
  `npm test` after each wave; the engine waves additionally need the
  byte-identical regression gate (law 8's tripwire). Keep the tree buildable
  throughout. Wave map: docs/agents-archive.md.
## Architecture

**THE FOLD IS IN THE RUST ENGINE (JOS-459, deleted from TypeScript by JOS-499).** One child process
parses, folds and serves; this app is a client. The full design, the owner's 27 rulings and the
remaining backlog live in `docs/plans/data-server.md`, main's half is mapped in
`src/main/dataServer/README.md`, and the engine's own side in `engine/crates/engined/README.md`.

```
EverQuest client ──appends──► log file ──► ENGINE (engine/crates/engined, below-normal priority)
                                             tail + scan + parse → fold (20 modules + combat)
                                             → views (filtered, sorted, windowed, render-ready)
                                             → JSON over loopback TCP, one line per message
   Electron main ──spawns/supervises──┘         │
     supervisor.ts (spawn, token, respawn, READY on a proven round trip)
     engineClientHost.ts (attach, the four streams, engineRequest)
     rendererBroker.ts (byte relay: a renderer gets its OWN connection; main never parses a frame)
   Renderers ─── useView(descriptor) ─────────┘   loading / error / reconnecting states;
                                                  NEVER re-sorts or re-filters what arrives
                                                  (ruling 4, enforced by eslint.domainMunging.mjs)
```

Two boundary laws hold this up, and both FAIL THE BUILD rather than relying on memory:

- **the engine's own budgets** — `engine/crates/engined/tests/budget.rs`, `npm run budget:ci` in CI
  on every push, `npm run budget:g3` at the release cut;
- **the renderer never munges domain data** — `eslint.domainMunging.mjs`, scoped to
  `src/renderer/**`, exemptions inline and reasoned, count only ever shrinks
  (`tests/domainMunging.test.mts`).

- **THE LOG CLOCK IS THE HOST'S TO NAME, AND A SILENT UTC IS A DEFECT (JOS-536).** A log stamp is
  a zone-less local wall clock; the engine's own probe (`iana-time-zone`, a WinRT call) fails under
  Wine and on some real installs, and a UTC fallback moves every event by whole hours so fights close
  on every beat. `session.attach` carries the host's `clock` (IANA name + UTC offset, read fresh per
  attach), `eqlog::resolve_zone` ranks host name → platform probe → fixed offset → UTC, an offset
  vetoes a name that disagrees with it, and `perf.snapshot.clockSkewMs` measures the live tail's
  newest line against the wall clock — a whole number of hours there is a wrong zone, never lag.
  In a bug report's perf block, `behindMs` of exactly N hours is this bug; `clock utc` names it.

**ENGINE COMMENTS STATE THE RULE, NOT THE STORY (owner, 2026-08-27, JOS-524).** A comment
names a design rule or a constraint the code cannot show: 1-3 lines, one-line why. Module
headers, single-digit lines. Out: build history, `JOS-nnn` breadcrumbs, alternatives essays,
restatements of the next line, pointers to another file's header. **Git carries provenance;
comments carry the rule.** An unverifiable fact (observed behaviour, measured threshold) is
kept, in one line.

The world-model laws below are still the law — they describe what the fold MEANS, and every one of
them was ported to Rust and proven deep-equal on six slices of the real log before the TypeScript
copy was deleted. Where one names a TypeScript file that is gone, read it for the RULE.
Maps: src/main/maps (pack discovery/per-layer cross-pack merge/LRU/search,
Electron-free w/ injected roots) over shared/maps types + shared/zones
(THE zone-knowledge table); renderer features/maps (canvas geometry, DOM
labels w/ collision declutter, floor slicing). Pure fns + goldens all over.
  **`mapFromLoc` IS THE ONE `/loc`→map SEAM** (`mapX=-ew, mapY=-ns`, y grows
  SOUTH — JOS-65). Wiki mob pins and the user's typed-/loc marker (JOS-98,
  `eq.maps.loc`, per zone) both go through it and then through `project`;
  a second copy of those negations is the bug this repo already shipped once.
  Live self-position is authorized in this fork (2026-09-08). `docs/live-map.md`
  defines version checks, bounded read-only access, stale-position handling, and user controls.
Renderer: `useView(descriptor)` — subscribe, take the reset, ride the diffs, and drop everything on
an epoch bump (resume is always re-query). `useModule` was its predecessor and went with the fold.
Overlay = second renderer entry (overlay.html) with a minimal `eqOverlay` bridge (transparent
alwaysOnTop, click-through pin).
```

- **A WINDOW READING A FOLD NEEDS BOTH HALVES OF THE TRANSPORT — THE INCREMENTS
  AND THE REBUILD** (JOS-172, and the engine's diff protocol is built on it).
  An increment is an increment: a historical fold emits none, so "hydrate once,
  then ride deltas" is only complete if something says *ask again*. In the
  engine that answer is the EPOCH — a character switch or a respawn bumps it,
  every client drops its window state and takes the fresh reset, and resume is
  always re-query. `sendWorldChanged` (serveDeltas.ts) is the app-side beat.
  The fix is the DELIVERY, never the discard. **And re-hydration is a SECOND
  reason a row can vanish**: anything watching a row set for removals is
  told which kind of change it sees (`timerDrops` takes a `rebuilt` flag and
  says nothing across a re-fold). Full story + the e2e slow-fold trick:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
- **A MODULE WITH A SECOND INPUT MUST REPORT ITS OWN REVISION AS `seq`, NOT
  THE LAST EVENT'S** (JOS-87). Any reader deduping on `seq` — the app's
  mirrors and the engine's own cursors both do — only works when "last
  LogEvent seq folded in" is the whole story, i.e. when state moves ONLY on
  events; the
  combo module's user correction advanced no seq, so an idle-log correction
  was dropped as a duplicate — forever, on an idle log. Fix: a private
  counter bumped by anything that can change state, reported by the module's
  own snapshot, plus the PUSH half — an out-of-band write has to make the
  world publish, or the correction sits in a module nobody re-reads. Four
  modules carry such a counter (combo, character, respawn, buffTimers).
  A unit test cannot see either half; `tests/e2e/loadout-override.e2e.mts` is
  what caught it. Full story: docs/agents-archive.md.
- **Character epochs**: character-scoped state (leveling/AA, loot, kills,
  turnins, buffs live-state) resets at the epoch boundary — anchored at
  OFFICIAL LAUNCH 2026-07-28 (`epochDetector.ts`; the user's beta character
  shared this log file pre-launch). Do NOT use level regression (loadout
  swaps legitimately change level). Game-knowledge (mined durations,
  message overlay) persists across epochs.
- **A LOGOUT PAUSES YOUR CHARACTER, NOT THE WORLD — SO BUFFS FREEZE AND
  DEBUFFS DO NOT** (JOS-134, owner's design 2026-08-09). EQ resumes a
  beneficial buff's REMAINING duration at login
  (`BuffInstances.onOfflinePause`; the S5 fixture proves it to the second); a
  debuff you left on a mob is a timer in the WORLD and is never shifted
  (`modules/buffTimers.ts` takes an EXPLICIT no-op on `offlineGap`). **The
  boundary is evidence, not a timeout — AND SINCE JOS-262 THERE IS NO TIMEOUT
  LEFT ANYWHERE IN IT.** ONE shared predicate decides both halves:
  `sessionDetector.ts inWorldEvidence` — a line that could ONLY have been
  printed for THIS character. It anchors `fromTs`, and
  `modules/buffsSession.ts` rules a hole unexplained only when such a line
  arrives with no intervening login. **"Typed" is NOT the test and the log
  says so**: a stranger's kill in the reconnect preamble proves the CLIENT
  is connected and nothing about you. The priced cost: `fromTs` stays a
  LOWER bound, so a gap never under-states an absence and runs long. **And
  the learner refuses BOTH halves of a cycle that spans an absence**
  (`spannedGap`) — both err LONG, the direction law 5's recency-weighted MAX
  is most sensitive to. Censor, never correct. Zoning is not a logout; death
  still clears (JOS-88). Full story + the measurements:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
- **Spell DB**: `src/main/data/spells.json` (~1.9k spells from eqlwiki
  `Template:Spellpage`: durations, cast/wear-off messages, illusion flag,
  Beneficial/Detrimental) + `messageOverlay.baseline.json` + per-user
  learned overlay (overlay wins over wiki), injected via rulesets
  `ParserConfig`. Learned counts are filed PER SOURCE and a re-fold replaces
  its own bucket — JOS-231's law in the checkpoint tombstone below; read it
  before touching the miner's seed or `<userData>/message-overlay.json`.
  **AND SINCE JOS-251 IT CARRIES WHAT A SPELL DOES** — `SpellEntry.effects`
  is the wiki's numbered effect list VERBATIM, and
  `src/main/data/spellEffectClass.ts` is the separable OVERLAY that reads
  them; rules anchor at the HEAD of the effect sentence (a name stem matched
  substrings of NAMES — `charm` found `Naki's Charm of Pernicity`). The
  derived charm roster IS `ParserConfig.charmSpell` now (`CHARM_STEMS` the
  fallback); `ccSpell` is still stems ON PURPOSE — the derived hold roster
  disagrees on 19 spells incl. `Ensnare`, reconciling is an owner ruling,
  and the derivation's answer is pinned in
  `tests/spellEffectClass.test.mts` waiting for it. Full detail:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
  **THE SCRAPE IS REVISION-KEYED AND BATCHED**
  (`scripts/sources/cache/spells/index.json` records the revid per cached
  page); a re-run with an unchanged spell list is a byte-identical no-op —
  but a re-scrape is a DATA CHANGE, not a refresh. Diff it, do not skim it.
- **Alerts**: declarative JSON `AlertDef` in electron-store; triggers =
  primitives (event kind + `where` match, raw regex, app signal) or
  composites `{any|all}` (same-event semantics only). Module evaluates
  live-only with cooldowns; renderer plays sounds. Sound packs live in
  `resources/soundpacks` + userData; the ONE shipped default (Alan Rickman,
  `src/main/data/defaultPacks.ts`) is gitignored audio and SELF-PROVISIONS
  at startup from its pinned registry tag — seeded + suggested alert defs
  reference its derived soundIds. App signals (bossDefeat, questComplete)
  fire from single always-mounted detectors.
  **PRESENCE IS NOT PRECEDENCE: THE DEFAULT PACK IS A PREFERENCE, AND A
  DELETION IS A STATEMENT** (JOS-273, owner ruling 2026-08-13 — verbatim:
  *if someone deletes alan rickman, they should be able to set a default and
  it should persist*). Startup provisioning used to re-install the shipped
  pack with no memory of a deletion. Three parts, all in
  `src/shared/soundPacks.ts` (pure core) + `storeSoundPacks.ts` (accessors):
  (1) the PREFERENCE `soundPacks.defaultPackId` — honoured by every picker
  pre-selection, the suggestion builder and the SEEDS; set from the pack
  browser's star. (2) the TOMBSTONE `soundPacks.removedPackIds` —
  uninstalling a SHIPPED pack records it, `packsToProvision` skips it,
  installing again clears it. (3) RESOLUTION, not silence: `resolveSoundRef`
  resolves a dead ref through the preference keeping its CESP category, and
  where nothing can answer the alert ROW says so (`soundNotice`). FRESH
  INSTALLS ARE UNCHANGED (absent preference ⇒ identity, no schema bump); the
  renderer's `DEFAULT_PACK_ID` mirror STAYS (a compile-time fact about what
  the app SHIPS). Pinned: tests/defaultPackPreference.test.mts +
  tests/e2e/default-sound-pack.e2e.mts. Full story: docs/agents-archive.md.
  **A `where.spell` MATCHER TESTS THE WHOLE CANDIDATE LIST, NEVER THE FIRST PICK**
  (JOS-84). EQ prints ONE landing/wears-off sentence per spell FAMILY, so
  `buffApply.spell` / `buffWearOff.spell` are a best-effort first candidate
  while `candidates` carries the truth; the wizard's `lands` template pinned
  the first pick and could never fire. `spellCandidateNames` widens the
  `spell` key (only that key, only when the event carries candidates) and
  `matchedSpellName` reports the one that satisfied the def. When one
  sentence is five spells, the alert is an alert on the FAMILY — which is
  also what keeps it alive across the level-up that replaces the spell. Full
  story: docs/agents-archive.md.
  **A LITERAL `where.spell` MATCHER IS RANK-BLIND — ALL RANKS, FULL STOP**
  (JOS-259, owner ruling 2026-08-12; domain law, verbatim: once you upgrade a
  spell it never downgrades, even on a loadout swap). Only SOME of a spell's
  lines carry the roman numeral — `castBegin`/`resist` keep it, the wear-off
  family prints the bare name — so whole-string equality let one def satisfy
  half its own spell's lines. A literal spec now compiles with
  `spellLineKey(spec)` beside it and `accepts` (main/modules/alerts.ts)
  compares the folded keys when the exact compare misses — a pure WIDENING,
  so a def pinned to a rank still fires on it. Untouched, on purpose:
  `/regex/` specs (user intent, not a spelling), every non-`spell` key, and
  `damage.skill` (an owner call of its own). NO upgrade-offer compensation:
  `detectRankUpgrades` still only sees suffixed defs — now a convenience
  rather than the thing between a user and a sound. Pinned in
  tests/rankBlindSpellAlerts.test.mts.
  **AND THE LAW HAS NO CARVE-OUTS LEFT: RANKS DECIDE NOTHING IN THE ALERT SYSTEM**
  (JOS-276, owner ruling 2026-08-13 — verbatim: *we should not use spell ranks for
  anything in the alert system - it should be compatible with any rank*). The
  damage lane folds via `foldsRank`/`foldReaches` gated on `dtype 'spell'|'dot'`
  (melee skills are table constants, `ds` is free text — the gate sits on the
  dtype, never the measurement); the app-authored slow rosters and the wizard
  rank-chip dedupe folded too. Rank-SENSITIVE survivors are justified in place
  (`spellLastCast`, `detectRankUpgrades`, `matcherAccepts`); cooldown and
  early-warning identities are rank-blind by construction. Pins: the D-series in
  tests/rankBlindSpellAlerts.test.mts. Full sweep story: docs/agents-archive.md.
  **CAPTURE GROUPS SPEAK THE LOG, AND THE THREAT MODEL IS IN THE CODE** (JOS-103,
  `src/shared/alertCaptures.ts` — read its header before touching any of
  this). Alert defs are SHAREABLE, so a capture is a channel with a third
  party at each end. Five controls, each enforced at BOTH ends (main
  harvests, the resolver re-checks): shared sanitizers; `MAX_CAPTURE_CHARS`
  48; a value may come ONLY from the text the def's own condition just
  tested — **there are no ambient tokens**; named-only declarations, never
  GINA's positional `{S1}`; ONE left-to-right pass with a FUNCTION replacer.
  Unknown tokens render LITERALLY. Honest limits are stated in the file (a
  loose `raw` pattern can still MATCH a chat line — which is why
  `subjectCapturePattern` anchors `^\[[^\]]*\] `, never a bare `\] `). Full
  threat analysis: docs/agents-archive.md.
  **`{target}` IS THE ONE TOKEN THE APP FILLS IN ITSELF, AND THE EXEMPTION IS
  ONE NAME WIDE** (JOS-353, owner ruling 2026-08-14: Companion parses which mob
  a spell is affecting and exposes it as a variable — `haste {target}` — and it
  MUST NOT require heavy regex or custom intervention). `src/shared/
  alertTargets.ts` is the mechanism AND the argument; read its header before
  adding a second such token. It gives up exactly control 4 of the capture
  threat model ("a token is a declaration") and keeps everything else: ONE name,
  never a namespace; a value from a CLOSED TABLE of parser-extracted ENTITY
  fields on the SAME event the def matched (`target` on the buff/combat lanes,
  `mob` on the hold lanes — a user must never have to know which), so a `raw`
  trigger that matched a chat line gets nothing; the same sanitizer and 48-char
  cap as every other capture; and the editor prints it beside the pattern's own
  groups, so a shared def is still a readable finite list. The parser's
  SENTINELS are read as English (`self` → "you", `pet` → "your pet"; an ABSENT
  `buffFade.target` IS the self form) and matched case-SENSITIVELY, so a player
  named `Self` stays `Self`. It adds no exposure — a def could already have
  written `(?<target>…)` over the same line with a looser class. THE VALUE ONLY
  LEAVES MAIN IF THE PHRASE ASKED FOR IT: the wanted set compiles from the def's
  own phrase, so every alert that does not say `{target}` has a byte-identical
  delta, and a DECLARED group of that name always wins. Five suggestion
  templates ship a phrase carrying it (`lands`, `fade`, `wearsOff`, `breaks`,
  `charmBreaks` — `landsOnYou`/`healsOverTime` would be tautologies). Pinned:
  tests/alertTargetToken.test.mts, whose audit re-reads shared/logEvents.ts and
  fails when a new kind grows an entity field without a ruling.
  **A TEMPLATE FLAG IS A CLAIM THE ALERT CAN FIRE, AND THREE OF THEM WERE
  LYING** (JOS-103). `suggestionTemplates` is an exhaustive table over the
  DB's 33 observed `spellType`s — a spell with no template is DROPPED from
  the catalog; `lands` is not offered where no `buffApply` can ever be
  emitted; `wearsOff` is an `any` composite over `buffExpired` +
  `buffWearOff`; a family with NO typed event at all (Spirit of the Puma's
  landing line) gets a `raw` trigger — the only thing that exists for it.
  **AND `suggestions.ts` IS NODE-TESTED NOW** (imports relative, repo law):
  `tests/suggestedAlertsFire.test.mts` drives a real suggested def through
  the real parser into the real module. Full story: docs/agents-archive.md.
  **A MEZ HAS NO `buffExpired`, SO IT GETS THE EVENT IT ACTUALLY HAS** (JOS-161).
  `wearsOff` rests on the derived `buffExpired`, which only an AUTHORITATIVE
  wear-off message synthesizes; a hold on a mob has none — its wear-off is
  claimed by `classifyWornOff` and becomes `cc {refresh:true}`. The `breaks`
  template is `{cc, where:{spell, refresh:'true'}}`, gated on the parser's
  own `ccSpell` roster (exported from rulesets.ts for exactly this reader).
  Same honest limit as the group: "it ended", never "it ended early". Full
  story: docs/agents-archive.md.

- **THE CORRECTIONS OVERLAY CAN RENAME, AND A NAME IS A JOIN KEY** (JOS-161,
  `src/main/data/spellCorrectionsList.ts` — the evidence bar and the five
  drift classes live in that header; `spellCorrections.ts` is the mechanism).
  The fifth drift class is the name itself (`Solon's Bravura` on the wiki,
  `Solon's Bewitching Bravura` in every line the game prints), and the name
  is a join key everywhere. TWO RULES: a name correction writes EVERY row of
  that name, and it reports `unknownSpells` rather than `stale` when it rots;
  the audit test fails on either list. **And every index keyed by spell name
  must read the CORRECTED entries** — `spellClasses.ts` and
  `levelUnlocks.ts` do; a raw-`spells.json` importer that looks up BY NAME is
  a silent miss waiting to happen. Full story: docs/agents-archive.md.
  Since JOS-440 the drift can also run the OTHER way: the wiki retitled a
  page the game never renamed (`Invisibility vs. Undead`), and the correction
  restores the game's spelling — the log and `spells_us.txt` outrank the wiki
  on names, always.

- **THE REMOVALS LAYER MAKES TWO CLAIMS NOW** (JOS-440,
  `src/main/data/spellRemovals.ts` `supersededBy`): the original absence
  claim ("no player can learn this; the row leaves the DB", instrument: a
  person, dated) and the duplicate-page claim ("the wiki documents one spell
  twice; THIS page is the copy EQ Legends is not running; the row named in
  `supersededBy` survives", instrument: the client's own `spells_us.txt`,
  dated). A superseded entry withdraws nothing from the player — a duplicate
  leaves, the survivor must outlive the whole load (asserted by name), and
  removals run BEFORE corrections so a survivor may be a row a rename lands
  on. Only a `supersededBy` entry may claim a rename target.

- **WINDOWS CAN SILENCE THIS APP AT VOLUME 0.000 WITH MUTE=FALSE** (JOS-442, measured
  live): the mixer's per-app slider is persisted PER EXECUTABLE and PER DEVICE,
  survives restarts, is restored when a device returns (the owner's headset
  re-appearing re-applied a zero), and the app's row is only VISIBLE in the mixer
  while a session is live (~seconds after a sound). So "all audio silent, nothing
  muted, mixer looks empty" is this, and hunting a mute finds nothing.
  **AND THE APP HAS NO TOOL FOR IT, BY RULING** (JOS-443, owner, verbatim: *we
  don't need any special audio debugging tools at all*). The JOS-442
  diagnostics (WASAPI session reader, `audio:session` IPC, the Preferences
  check card) are DELETED; the app's answer is the Windows volume mixer, and
  the mechanism above stays written down so the owner can recognise the
  failure himself. What SURVIVES: a failed sound fetch is never cached
  (`soundCache` evicts null resolutions so the next firing retries), every
  fetch/play failure writes ONE per-key-per-minute line to errors.log
  (`alerts/audioHealth.ts` + `shared/audioFailureLog.ts`), and a device
  change leaves a `console.info` breadcrumb. No readout state is kept —
  state nobody reads is state that rots.
  **AND THE E2E SUITE MAKES NO SOUND** (same ticket): every harness launch
  passes Chromium's `--mute-audio` (`tests/e2e/appWindow.mts launchApp`,
  `scripts/site-screens.mts`). It silences the OUTPUT, not the code —
  `play()` still resolves or rejects — so behaviour assertions are unchanged.
  Deleted-tooling story: docs/agents-archive.md.

### Electron trust boundary (do not weaken)

- ONE `WEB_PREFERENCES()` in `src/main/windows.ts` (module-private, beside the only
  code that creates a BrowserWindow) builds the webPreferences for EVERY window
  (main + all five overlays) — never inline a second opinion. contextIsolation
  on; nodeIntegration (+InWorker/+InSubFrames), webviewTag,
  allowRunningInsecureContent, experimentalFeatures, enableBlinkFeatures,
  navigateOnDragDrop, spellcheck all off; webSecurity on. Stated explicitly even
  where they match Electron's default — the default is someone else's decision.
- `sandbox:false` is a PACKAGING blocker, not a choice: both preloads
  `require()` a shared rollup chunk, and a sandboxed preload's `require`
  resolves only `electron` + a tiny polyfill set (MEASURED: flipping it
  kills e2e with `module not found` and no `window.eq`). Nothing in the
  preloads needs Node, so `sandbox:true` (and `app.enableSandbox()`)
  unlocks the moment electron.vite.config.ts emits each preload as ONE
  self-contained file.
- Navigation/window-open/webview policy is installed ONCE from
  `app.on('web-contents-created')` (hardenWebContents), never per window: a
  window added later must not be able to miss it. `will-navigate` allows only the
  bundled renderer dir (or, in dev, the electron-vite server's ORIGIN — the
  server's own URL, so 5173/5174 both work); `setWindowOpenHandler` is
  deny-always and hands ONLY an allowlisted https URL to `shell.openExternal`.
  **That allowlist is the boundary, not a formality**: link URLs are built from
  WIKI PAGE TITLES (`shared/wiki.ts`), and an unvalidated openExternal would let
  one ask the OS to run `file:///…exe`. Widen `EXTERNAL_LINK_ALLOWLIST`
  (security.ts) deliberately or not at all, **and an entry is a HOST PLUS AN
  OPTIONAL PATH SCOPE — write the narrowest one that serves the link** (owner
  ruling, JOS-263). Widened ONCE (JOS-254), with a REPO-SCOPED github.com
  entry — only `https://github.com/jmoyers/everquest-companion/…` opens; the
  three wiki entries stay host-wide because a wiki link's PATH is a page title
  this app cannot predict. The path prefix is matched SEGMENT-AWARE
  (`…-companion-evil` is not inside `…-companion`) against the
  WHATWG-normalized pathname, so `..` — and its `%2e%2e` spelling — is
  resolved away before the check. Full rationale: docs/agents-archive.md.
  All permissions are denied wholesale
  (this app needs none); pure policy lives in `src/main/security.ts` and is
  pinned by `tests/security.test.mts` (no Electron, never skips).
- Renderer-supplied strings that reach `join()` are validated AT THE IPC
  HANDLER (`sounds:getData`'s packId → `isSafePackId`), not trusted because
  today's only caller is the app's own UI.

## World-model laws (hard-won; do not relearn these)

1. **Messages over inference.** Applications, targets, expiry come from
   explicit chat lines (cast-on-you/other, wears-off, "Your illusion
   fades.", "slows down.", resists). Estimates are display-only countdowns.
   Anything inferred is LABELED inferred — never silently guess.
2. **Names are dirty; canonicalize at boundaries, display raw.**
   Case-insensitive keys (`idKey`) everywhere (lifecycle lines lowercase
   articles; damage lines capitalize). Strip spell rank suffixes (casts say
   `Swift Like the Wind I`, fades are rank-less) and item ` +N` variants at
   COUNTING boundaries only. Strip leading a/an/the for boss matching.
   OUR OWN labels are dirty too: `WorldModel.label()` appends a
   spawn-generation ` (N)` suffix ("the 14th capturer this session") that
   rides `currentTarget` into lookups — `mobKey` strips it; it is display
   flavor, never identity. The suffix appears in NO log line.
3. **Shared messages are the norm.** 123 wears-off families ("Your speed
   returns to normal." = 9 hastes), generic illusion landings ("You feel
   different."). Parser carries candidate lists; the MODEL resolves against
   the active set / session cast history.
4. **Entities, not names; disposition, not identity.** Buffs are
   (spell, entity) instances; "pet" is NOT a data-model class (self renders
   first, others second — presentation only). Charm break keeps the entity
   + buffs (re-charm same name w/o death/zone = same entity). Single-pet
   invariant: new claim/charm retires the prior pet — enforced in TWO models
   with different reach, measured, not an oversight (JOS-54):
   `modules/buffs.ts` retires across BOTH kinds at the buff-entity level; the
   combat `WorldModel` retires only BY KIND (`claim()` retires the prior
   SUMMONED pet — the successor's claim is the only evidence a recast prints;
   `charm()` retires nothing there; the crossover is an unobserved shape and
   gets no invented rule — awaiting-sample law). Retirement is not deletion:
   the old pet keeps every point already attributed (rows key by instanceId)
   and only stops being yours for FUTURE admission, so the engine's
   `petNames` index follows the world model out
   (`EngineState.syncPetNames`). **AND THE CLAIM IS WHAT TRIGGERS IT, NOT THE
   SUMMON** (JOS-188): an upgraded pet is a new NAME; three lines produce the
   claim (tell / leader say / your own pet-only buff landing), all through
   one `bindPetClaim`, on purpose. Zoning: self + summoned pet keep buffs;
   charmed pets/hostiles are left behind (censor). Deaths retire.
   **Unobservable fades censor, never pollute stats.** Own-cast gating: never
   track buffs we didn't cast (10s cast window or a Quick Buff burst).
   **A HEALER OF YOURS IS NOT NECESSARILY A PLAYER (JOS-48).** Your own
   lifetap's recourse prints as `<mob> healed you …`, and filing that mob as
   a KNOWN PLAYER deleted every pet swing at it. The refusal is
   `EngineState.everStruck` — **a name YOU have landed damage on is a mob**,
   the third absolute guard beside `everPet` and `everCharmed`, and it is
   BEHAVIOURAL (the mobs catalog is never consulted, so it holds for a
   proper-named guard the catalog never heard of). The wider rule ("anything
   ever ENGAGED as a hostile") is MEASURED WRONG — a mind-controlled healer
   hits YOU first; being hit is something that HAPPENS to you, hitting is
   something you DO, and only the second names a mob. One direction only: the
   refusal never RETIRES a filing the heal got in ahead of. Measurements:
   docs/agents-archive.md.
5. **Aggregates lie; derive from identities.** AA earned = net allocation
   (latest purchase per ability+rank, cost-0 auto-grants excluded) +
   unspent (last authoritative "You now have" − later spends); sum-of-gains
   double-counts respec refunds. Durations: DB authoritative, else
   recency-weighted MAX (median biases low via censored samples).
6. **Say what the log cannot say** (documented non-distinguishables — never
   invent): main/off-hand; double/triple attack (SILENT extra swings —
   zero annotations in 1.35M lines; the rounds model (combat/rounds.ts,
   wave X 118f0c2) infers by (source, verb, TARGET, second) with
   cross-target fan-out collapse, per-event ONLY on reuse-timer verbs,
   aggregate-rate-with-inferred-chip on dual-wieldable weapon verbs, and
   the player's own Rampage swings are unannotated = outgoing rampage
   unknowable); ground pickups (NO line exists — the loot family is the
   only item-acquisition line); self-buff fades (only wears-off emotes);
   mob HP. Fight NAMING (Task #54): a LIVE fight is named after the CURRENT
   target (most recent outgoing target — the mob in front of you); on FINALIZE
   it switches to the LARGEST target ("most damage absorbed", a labeled proxy).
   Both keep the '+N' others suffix. `encounterName(e, live)`.
7. **Encounters close on evidence**: all engaged instances dead (+~5s
   linger); live CC (mez lines) holds fights open indefinitely; ~60s idle
   fallback for fled mobs. DPS = damage/(lastHit−firstHit); active-time
   DPS is the secondary stat. A zone change FINALIZES the live zone aggregate
   into a capped HISTORY (Task #54; last 20 sessions — frozen agg + timing +
   memoized summary, NO per-event rings, ~0.6MB full-log) instead of discarding
   it, so a past zone's overall meter stays selectable; the snapshot exposes
   `zoneSessions` (live first, id 'zone'; finalized 'zs<n>') and buildSelected
   accepts a session id. Selector rows (main + overlay) carry disambiguation
   timing: start clock (formatDate) · coarse live-updating age · duration.
8. **Miss/resist are first-class, damage-free** (Task #51 v2): a miss
   (avoided melee swing) and a resist (fully-resisted spell) attach to the
   fresh encounter + zone aggregate with the SAME attribution as damage
   (you/pet/incoming; hostile-mob-vs-mob resists dropped) but carry NO
   amount — so every damage total stays byte-identical (the tripwire, per
   source: `Σ category.total == source.total`). They enter the timeline
   ring as hollow/red ticks (miss -> "Melee" lane; resist -> the spell's own
   lane, so an always-resisted mez shows a 0-hit / N-resist lane). Rates:
   melee hit% = hits/(hits+misses) [hits counts ALL landed incl. spells —
   the per-category melee row isolates pure melee]; resist% =
   resists/(spell+dot casts + resists), surfaced at source / category /
   per-spell rows. A miss/resist NEVER opens or extends an encounter (only
   damage/CC does), so instants before the first hit go to the zone
   aggregate only. Ring cap 5k→8k (misses ~2× the density; sole marathon
   fight peaks 5259 instants — fits with zero drop-oldest; ≤60 rings
   retained, <1MB). Timeline zoom/pan is renderer-side view-window state
   (wheel = cursor-anchored zoom, shift-wheel/drag = pan, Fit = reset,
   starts fit); windowed by visible time range so the SVG stays cheap.
9. **One time base per chart.** A curve's vertices, markers, axis and hover
   inverse all read ONE `{t0, t1, bucketMs}`; samples anchor at bucket
   centres; live windows advance in whole buckets. Mixing an index-fraction
   vertex mapping with a time-fraction marker mapping stretched markers a
   full bucket at the right edge, and a wall-clock window length made them
   swim against a still curve every tick (fixed 5a9dbc2). Canvas is never
   the answer to arithmetic disagreement. Chart interaction seam: hover
   binds pointermove/pointerleave ONLY and bails when `ev.buttons !== 0`;
   drag interactions own pointerdown/up/cancel; a `suppressed` prop ties
   them without shared state.
10. **Revisable intervals JOIN AT READ; nothing stamps their ids.** Combo
   intervals (fuzzy, retroactively re-labeled by a later /who or a user
   correction) are queried by timestamp (`comboAt`/`groupByCombo`); an id
   stamped onto a boss kill goes stale with no reconciliation path.
   Persisted corrections key on TIME; interval ids are recompute-unstable
   and never leave the renderer.
11. **Exclusivity gates are RATE-AWARE.** "Never fired without X" requires
   the inactive exposure to PREDICT evidence (>= 3 expected firings at the
   lane's own active rate), never a flat swing floor — 289 swings deny
   Instrument of Nife what 225 earn Spellblade, and that asymmetry is the
   point. Direct observation beats the model (a lane that DID fire inactive
   is never "under-sampled"). States active for the same firings declare
   co-exclusivity — two rows never silently claim one body of evidence.
12. **Cross-source name RENAMES are knowledge, never fuzzy.** The log, the
   mob catalog and the map stems disagree by NAME (The Ruins of Old
   Paineel = The Hole), not spelling. `shared/zones.ts` is the ONE
   hand-authored, evidence-verified artifact (short names, aliases,
   `catalogZonesFor`); closest-match would conflate genuinely distinct
   zones, and an anti-fuzzy tripwire pins two near-name rosters disjoint.
   A new gap gets a VERIFIED row, never a matcher.
13. **A DEATH→DEATH GAP IS AN UPPER BOUND, NOT A MEASUREMENT** (JOS-194,
   `shared/respawn.ts`). Respawn clocks start on the death MESSAGE, numbered
   from your own kills; the wiki is a bad primary source (394 readable
   respawns across 7,872 pages), so the ladder is: your typed number, then
   your kills, then the wiki as a DEFAULT before you have kills and a FLOOR
   under them once you do. Every observed gap is `respawn + your delay`, so
   the SMALLEST gap converges downward; it prints as `≤` with the sample
   count, and a clock at zero says **due**, never "spawned" (laws 1, 6). Two
   evidence rules keep the bound honest: a gap counts only when both deaths
   fall inside ONE stated stay in the zone (a zone line ends the stay even
   when it names the same zone), and two deaths of one name inside 60 s are
   two mobs in one pull (the shortest catalog respawn is 78 s). The committed
   floor keeps each page's VERBATIM text beside the parsed seconds
   (`--reparse` re-derives with NO network).
   **TRACKING IS OPT-IN PER MOB, AND THE DISPLAY IS ZONE-SCOPED** (owner):
   EQ names are massively DUPLICATED, so a clock nobody asked for is a clock
   about a mob the app cannot identify. Recently-killed is the discovery
   surface; a clock exists only on Watch or a typed number; surfaces show
   only the zone you are in, filtered by the module's OWN zone-stay state
   (the empty zone is its own BUCKET; `due` never widens the filter). The
   zone is part of what the screen shows, so the module bumps `rev` on a
   zone line (JOS-87's rule, re-learned) — watch list, zone line, sighting
   and confirmation all bump it.
   **AND A CLOCK MUST YIELD TO THE LOG NAMING THE MOB** (owner): a row
   carries `seenTs` — the last instant a TYPED event named that mob while
   the fold stood in that zone — and a newer `seenTs` reads **UP**, sorting
   above every countdown; the UP state ages out (`RESPAWN_LINGER_MS`), never
   the row. Coverage is off EVENTS, never a raw-text scan; a corpse is
   deliberately NOT a sighting, or every kill would flip its own row up.
   **AND A SIGHTING NEVER AUTO-ADJUSTS THE SCHEDULE** — it proves the mob is
   UP, not when it spawned; re-basing is the explicit `Start clock here`
   affordance (`respawn:confirmSighting`, `basis:'sighting'`, base
   `max(death, confirmation)`), session state, never persisted.
   **AND UNWATCH LIVES ON THE MOB, WHEREVER YOU MEET IT** (owner): every
   surface naming a watched mob carries its own way out, all landing on ONE
   channel, `respawn:unwatch`, which takes the canonical mob KEY, removes
   the NAME, and throws away nothing else — watching again restores the
   identical clock (pinned on the WRITE: `tests/respawnUnwatch.test.mts`).
   Rounds 7-9, distilled: the tab is Timers; the duration + source label are
   ONE bordered unit (`RespawnEditDialog.tsx`; whitelist grammar
   `parseRespawnDuration`; `respawnOverridden` = the ladder saying
   `source === 'custom'`); the OVERLAY carries no editing; **a watched row
   NEVER vanishes while watched** (round 8 — what ages out is the SEEN
   state; unwatch is the only way a row leaves); the mob hover card is
   IN-APP ONLY. Full rounds history: docs/agents-archive.md.

## The fold checkpoint, and why there isn't one (JOS-208, removed by JOS-230)

For two days the app could restore its world model from a binary checkpoint
(JOS-208); the owner removed it anyway (JOS-230): the cold-read stall it
targeted did not survive its own instrumentation, and it taxed every fold
change with schema/goldens/census ceremony. WHAT SURVIVED, because it is the
app's and not the feature's: `tests/foldDeterminism.test.mts` (**a
historical replay reads no wall clock**), the engine's `st.hydrating` gate
(`tests/combatReplayClock.test.mts`), and
`MessageOverlayMiner.lastObservedTs` (a published snapshot's `updatedAt` is
the LOG's clock). Both product fixes were found by folding the same bytes
twice and diffing — reach for that again. If a startup-cost ticket comes
back: measure first, and read `git log 5038f6f0..1c3e584f`. Full
post-mortem: docs/agents-archive.md.

**A FOLD MUST NEVER BE SEEDED WITH WHAT IT IS ABOUT TO RE-DERIVE, AND THE ONLY
HONEST WAY TO KNOW IS TO FILE EVERY COUNT UNDER ITS SOURCE** (JOS-231). The
message overlay re-mines the whole log every launch; seeding it from its own
persisted served view double-counted every cold launch. `MessageOverlayMiner`
keeps ONE BUCKET PER SOURCE (`BASELINE_SOURCE` for the committed baseline),
`beginSource(key)` DISCARDS a bucket before its log is folded again,
`build()` sums the buckets — a re-fold REPLACES its source's contribution;
idempotence is structural. The persisted file is v2, a REGISTER with no
verdicts (a stored verdict is a second opinion waiting to disagree with the
derived one). The fix deliberately KEEPS the persisted seed (a bucket for a
character you are not folding is knowledge nothing can re-derive, and
`effectiveSpellDb` derives parser corrections from the seed BEFORE the
fold). `tests/messageOverlayIdempotence.test.mts` pins it all, with a
tripwire that re-creates the old shape and watches the counts double. Full
story: docs/agents-archive.md.

## Log-format quick reference (all validated against the real log)

The committed fixture tests (`tests/fixtures/*.log` + their suites) are the
AUTHORITY for line shapes; the rows kept here are the non-obvious laws, and
the full per-lane evidence lives in docs/agents-archive.md.

- Melee verbs CONJUGATE — match first person ("You slash") AND third
  ("slashes"); missing `smite`/`cleave` once hid 22% of all damage. Paren
  modifiers are COMPOUND: `(Riposte Slay Undead)`.
- **A VERB THAT NAMES A CLASS SKILL GETS ITS OWN LANE; A WEAPON VERB DOES
  NOT** (JOS-77, JOS-81). `meleeSkill()` (log/parseCombat.ts) splits
  Backstab, Bash, Kick, Frenzy, Flurry, Cleave (WAR) and Smite (PAL);
  slash/pierce/crush/hit/slice/claw/gore are what a weapon in a hand prints
  and share the generic "Melee" row (the Rounds panel splits those BY VERB).
  The table is HAND-AUTHORED against `data/classes.json`'s skill→class map —
  never a matcher over spelling. The proofs differ per lane; know them
  before adding one (full counts + hand tallies: docs/agents-archive.md):
  - Cleave (JOS-77): an ABSENCE — a verb that never prints for a player who
    lacks the skill is gated on the skill.
  - Smite (JOS-81): THE SKILL-UP STREAM — a weapon verb never ticks under
    its own name while `Smite` ticks beside Kick/Bash/Backstab. **THE SKILL
    LANE AND THE SPELL LANE SHARE A STEM AND MUST NEVER MERGE** — a spell
    literally named `Smite` exists; `tests/combatSmiteLane.test.mts` pins
    the collision on real bytes.
  - Ranged (JOS-92): **a weapon verb fired from a different SLOT than the
    hands is not the hand lane** — `shoot` ticks under `Archery`. THE
    DISCRIMINATOR IS THE VERB AND NOTHING ELSE; no thrown lane is invented
    beside it (awaiting-sample law); the self arm is INJECTED in
    `tests/combatRangedLane.test.mts`.
  - Strike (JOS-163): the GENERIC VERB every monk special prints as — an
    unnamed strike earns a row called **`Strike`**, the verb, never a name
    from the chain: the verb earns the ROW, the state line earns the NAME,
    and **no lane is ever seeded from the chain's first entry**
    (specialAttacks.ts's stated law).
  Law 8 held byte-identical across all four changes.
- **A HEAL THE LOG ANNOUNCES BUT NEVER VALUES GETS A LANE THAT CARRIES A COUNT
  AND NO NUMBER** (JOS-86 — the monk's Mend). `You mend your wounds and heal
  some damage.` is the whole sentence: no amount, no target, no third-person
  twin. THE FIX IS A KIND, NOT A FLAG: `healUnstated`, with **no amount
  field at all** (a `heal` with `amount: 0` would be a lie with a long
  tail). It enters NO sum and rides its own `HealSourceView.unstatedCount`
  so the crit and overheal rates beside it keep their VALUED denominator.
  FIRST PERSON ONLY, no invented arms (awaiting-sample law). Law 8 gate:
  every fixture diff was an ADDITION. Full story + the whole-log partition:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
- **SPECIAL ATTACKS PRINT NO VERB OF THEIR OWN.** Dragon Punch, Eagle Strike
  and Tiger Claw ALL land as `You strike …`; Round Kick and Flying Kick as
  `You kick …`. The game names the live one exactly once (`You will now use
  <X> while auto attacking.` — a GRANT, also how a lane RESETS — and
  `… instead of <Y> …`, an in-lane upgrade), so the lane label is STATE, not
  parsing: `combat/specialAttacks.ts` tracks the live special per VERB lane
  and ingest renames the skill. **`Slam instead of Bash` is REFUSED** — a
  documented non-distinguishable (law 6), not a guess. SKILL-UPS ARE NOT AN
  INPUT anywhere here. Full evidence: docs/agents-archive.md.
- Zone: `You have entered X.` — REJECT pseudo-zones ("an area where
  levitation…"). **The zone name is the ONLY thing that ever states a
  difficulty**, so `zoneTier()` decides what every kill's difficulty was,
  and it answers FOUR kinds of thing, not one number in five (JOS-166): a
  trailing `(Awakened|Adaptive|Fused|Refined)` = **d1–d4**; a `- Solo` /
  `- Group N` suffix with no adjective = **d0, the base INSTANCE with a real
  weekly lockout**; a bare zone name = **open world** (`TIER_OPEN_WORLD`, no
  lockout); empty or unknown adjective = **unknown** (`TIER_UNKNOWN`). The
  name is stripped of all three markers; all four are kill-record keys
  (`src/shared/kills.ts`), and only the five difficulties can green a weekly
  ladder rung. Pre-JOS-166 history: docs/agents-archive.md.
- Loot family (sole item-into-inventory lines): dashed
  `--You have looted X from Y's corpse.--`; currency (`…stored it in your
  currency`, NO period); sold (`…sold it for <money|free>.`). Dragon
  Hoard / depot / combine variants exist and are NOT yet parsed.
- AA: gains `…gained N ability point(s)! You now have M` (M = UNSPENT);
  spends in TWO formats (quoted rank-1 / `improved X <rank>`); cost-0 =
  auto-grants; respecs re-log purchases; no refund line exists. The quoted
  form is ALWAYS rank 1 and the improved form NEVER logs below rank 2, so a
  spend line states one rung of a per-ability LADDER — `shared/aaLedger.ts`
  regroups them. Two families that look like AA are NOT parsed, both
  deliberately: the `completed achievement` line restates a milestone the
  gain lines already carry (double-count risk), and `You activate X.` cannot
  distinguish an AA from a disc or a poison — a buffs/combat signal, never an
  AA-usage stat. Sweep: docs/agents-archive.md.
- Class SKILL grants share the AA verb: `You have gained the ability to use
  <Skill>.` (44×, Double Attack / Sneak / Riposte…) has NO cost clause and
  is not an AA purchase. `AA_ABILITY_RE` requires ` at a cost of`, which is
  the whole reason those lines never mint a spend.
- Resists (`resist` event, Task #51 v2): THREE shapes — `<target> resisted
  your <Spell>!` (caster=you), `<target> resisted <caster>'s <Spell>!`
  (caster=name; test YOUR form FIRST — 712 spell names contain `'s`), `You
  resist[ed] <mob>'s <Spell>!` (incoming). Spell keeps rank suffix for
  display, rank-normalized (spellCanonKey) for keys. Misses: `tries to … but
  misses!` family (miss/dodge/parry/riposte/block/absorb). Full-log sweep
  counts: docs/agents-archive.md.
- Stances: two mutually exclusive groups — 9 stances (`You assume a/an X
  stance.` — the article conjugates: "an offensive stance") and 9
  invocations (`You begin reciting the X invocation`);
  "begin to change your …" lines are flavor, not state.
- Quick Buff AA: `You activate Quick Buff.` → burst of landing emotes, NO
  cast lines. Permanent Illusion AA (ownership learned from its purchase
  line): illusion self-buffs permanent; ONE illusion per entity;
  `Your illusion fades.` is the shared remover.
  **THE BURST IS ALSO THE ONLY LINE THAT ENUMERATES YOUR GROUP BY NAME**
  (JOS-85): two or more `You healed <X> … by <Spell>.` lines in the SAME
  second — a fact about the ABILITY, not spell target types. It proves
  RECIPIENTS, not membership (bursts hit your own pets and, twice, a
  non-group-mate), so the roster admits a name only in conjunction with
  `You gain party experience!` earlier in the session (measured 2/2 correct,
  0 false positives). Weakest provenance rung (`buffed`); self / charmed /
  claimed-pet names refused. src/main/modules/buffFanOut.ts,
  docs/plans/group-model.md §1 G4; measurements: docs/agents-archive.md.
- Summoned pets have random proper names; they persist across zones (charmed
  pets do not). THREE binding signals, all through one `bindPetClaim`
  (ingest.ts), on purpose — a separate path would be a third retirement seam
  for some model to forget (law 4 is a scar from exactly that):
  - The owner-only tell `<Name> told you, '… Master.'` — **THE TELL ONLY
    FIRES WHEN THE PET IS ORDERED** (JOS-47); a pet engaging on its own
    aggro emits nothing private at all. **THE TELL IS THE WHOLE STORY, AND
    THE BLIND SPOT IS ACCEPTED** (owner, JOS-49): the ask-the-user offer and
    the pet-say nomination rung are DELETED — the answer is to order it
    once; an unordered pet is a documented non-distinguishable (law 6). **A
    TELL BINDS FORWARD, NOT BACKWARD** — nothing reaches back over damage
    already filed as nobody's.
  - The `/pet who leader` answer `<Name> says, 'My leader is <You>.'`
    (JOS-52) — EXACT sentence, never a `/leader/` pattern (the six-says
    rule). **THE LEADER'S NAME IS THE WHOLE GUARD** (compared to
    `ParserConfig.characterName`, session-injected) because the say is
    BROADCAST and forgeable — stated, costed, accepted. It parses to the
    SAME canonical `petClaim` event as the tell (`via: 'tell' | 'leader'`),
    so succession/idempotence/promotion are shared code.
  - **YOUR OWN PET-ONLY BUFF NAMES IT WITHOUT ASKING** (JOS-188): an own
    cast of a `targetType: Pet` spell (charmModel.ts `PET_TARGET_SPELLS`)
    ARMS the charm model and the named `buffApply` landing binds the pet.
    **THE MESSAGE IS NOT THE GATE, THE ARMED OWN CAST IS** — the landing's
    candidates must contain the spell being cast, and the arm is CONSUMED on
    a hit (a Quick Buff burst can never bind off one cast). This fixes the
    UPGRADED pet: a new name means succession triggers on the successor's
    claim, and an unordered successor had none.
  **AND THE APP NOW SAYS SO, ONCE, AND THEN STOPS** (JOS-258, owner ruling
  2026-08-12 — option (a), explicitly NOT a reopening of JOS-49). The blind
  spot is still accepted; the meter just no longer stays silent about it.
  `combat/petNudge.ts` arms on the player's own pet-summon cast
  (`spellEffectClass.ts`'s derived `summonPet` class; `Call Pet` excluded —
  it moves a pet rather than making one) and the overlay meter draws ONE
  sentence: *Pet summoned - order it once or type /pet who leader so the
  meter can see it.* **STALENESS AND REPETITION ARE THE FAILURE MODES, so
  the whole feature is a timeout**: 10s GRACE, 45s SHOW, 5m QUIET after one
  is ignored. ONE SLOT; cleared by any `bindPetClaim` (all three routes, one
  seam), by a fizzle/interrupt, or by its own clock — swept from the event
  stream AND from `snapshot(now)`. Armed only when `hydrating` is false.
  **IT COACHES, IT NEVER ADOPTS** — the unbound pet's damage is still
  dropped at routing while the sentence is up, and
  `tests/petSummonNudge.test.mts` asserts exactly that beside the timings.
  The renderer holds NO dismiss state (the snapshot's `petNudge` is absent
  in every state but the one). Full story: docs/agents-archive.md.
  A pet-claim tell from a name EVER seen charmed re-arms the charmed set,
  never the permanent one (`everCharmed`).
  **AND THE PET-BUFF RUNG IS NO LONGER THE COMBAT MODEL'S ALONE (JOS-454).**
  `bindPetBuffLanding` emits a derived `petClaim {via:'petBuff'}` on
  `bus.emitDerived` (Task #47's queue, the one `buffExpired` rides), so
  every model that binds a `petClaim` — progression's kill credit, buffs.ts
  entity succession, roster, the resist fold — learns the pet at the instant
  the meter does. ONE PRODUCER, ONE KIND, and the producer IGNORES its own
  kind (`ingestPetClaim`), which makes it provably loop-free. The ARM AND
  THE GATE ARE UNTOUCHED, so which names bind has not moved — only who is
  told. STILL NOT CLOSED: a pet its owner neither buffs nor orders stays
  invisible (order it once). Goldens: `p2`/`p3`/`p4` pet-arc logs,
  petBuffBind/petClaimWindows/petBuffKillCredit tests. The incident that
  bought it (Vibartik) + measurements: docs/agents-archive.md.
- Exp: `You gain (party )?experience!( (N.NN%))?` — the percent is an
  INCREMENT of the current level bar (sums to ~100 between dings);
  unstated ⇒ at the cap, modeled `pct: undefined` never 0. The exp line
  PRECEDES its kill line, same second (4,887/4,909) — joins consume the
  pending exp line at the next credited kill, never search forward.
- Self `/who` row (keyed on the tailed character's name via
  `ParserConfig.characterName`, never a constant) states the loadout;
  skill-ups `You have become better at <Skill>! (n)`; Wiki skill names ≠
  client skill names (`1 Hand Slashing` vs `1H Slashing`) — classes.json
  carries the alias table measured from the log.
  **A `/who` ROW IS GROUND TRUTH AT ITS TIMESTAMP, AND INFERENCE NEVER
  OUTRANKS IT** (JOS-192, JOS-287; the two live-log tripwires in
  comboWindows/comboWhoBoundary are this law): an interval may not
  contradict a row it covers, nor be extended or created BACKWARD over
  evidence that contradicts it. Two rows are two statements, never one
  event — so `mergeBoundaries` may narrow, move or absorb an INFERRED
  boundary but never a `/who` cut (`resolveGroup`), and an inferred window
  that covers a row cut is that swap dated better by the game (absorbed,
  recorded in `startAlso`). Frozen shape: fixture
  `cw7-who-swap-boundary-aug12.log` + tests/comboSwapBoundary.test.mts; the
  JOS-287 worked example: docs/agents-archive.md.
- **`Your <item> shimmers briefly.` / `feels alive with power.` IS A WORN
  FOCUS TALKING, NOT AN ITEM CASTING** (JOS-79, measured whole-log — this
  entry previously said the opposite and it was wrong). All five items that
  print it are focus items; the combo rule that acted on it is gone; the
  event stays and says nothing about class in either direction. A
  self-announcing clicky needs its own observed sample before any rule acts
  on one. Measurements: docs/agents-archive.md.
- Feign death has NO failure line (1.14M lines: only the success emote).
  An alert cannot fire on the absence of a line — the group ships hidden.
- **A TELL'S TENSE SAYS WHETHER A PERSON SENT IT** (JOS-69, measured
  whole-log): present tense (`tells you`) is a player, past tense (`told
  you`) is the game — that is the whole discriminator, and CAPITALIZATION IS
  NOT ONE (a charmed pet reads `A gorgon told you, …`). There is NO parsed
  tell event and no golden can carry one (the scrub drops all quoted
  speech), hence the `tells` alert group is a RAW trigger
  (`\] .+ tells you, '`) and its unit test constructs the sentence.
  Measurements: docs/agents-archive.md.
- **SLOWS ARE A ROSTER, NOT A NAME** (JOS-69). A slow wearing off a mob is
  the ordinary named-target `buffFade`, so the SPELL is the matcher and it
  has to be the whole family — a slow is the spell you replace as you level.
  spells.json enumerates it by landing emote; the ON-YOU side resolves to
  all-slow candidate lists, so the alert reports the family, never which
  one. Its tripwire is one word away: `Your speed returns to normal.` is
  NINE HASTES (law 3).
  **AND THE ROSTER HAS TWO SIDES NOW, BECAUSE ONE MEMBER CANNOT SAFELY BE ON
  BOTH** (JOS-233, owner ruling 2026-08-12): the bard binding pair joined
  the MOB side only — `The strands fade away.` is shared VERBATIM with a
  beneficial buff, and a `where.spell` matcher tests the whole candidate
  list (JOS-84); anchoring cannot fix identical sentences, only the split
  roster can. The wider binding line is EXPLICITLY UNRULED and stays silent;
  the table is in tests/charmCcRoster.test.mts. Full story:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
- **CHARM AND MEZ ARE ROSTERS TOO — AND THE SPELL DB IS THE ORACLE** (JOS-84).
  `Your <spell> spell has worn off of <mob>.` is ONE sentence for three
  facts; `rulesets.ts` matches the spell NAME: `charmSpell` ⇒ `uncharm`,
  `ccSpell` ⇒ `cc {refresh:true}`, neither ⇒ an ordinary `buffFade`. The
  rosters are enumerable from spells.json's landing-message families, and
  `tests/charmCcRoster.test.mts` RE-DERIVES both families every run — a
  future scrape that adds a member fails the suite instead of going mute.
  **A MESSAGE FAMILY IS NOT AN EFFECT FAMILY — THE ORACLE HAS BEEN WRONG IN
  BOTH DIRECTIONS** (Solon's Bewitching Bravura, a mez by family and really
  the bard's level-39 CHARM, JOS-200; both Largo's binding songs out of
  `ccSpell` entirely, JOS-225 — movement debuffs, settled by the log). Both
  reversals live as EVIDENCE-CARRYING TABLES in tests/charmCcRoster.test.mts
  (`FAMILY_EXCEPTIONS`, `NOT_A_HOLD`) precisely so the next scrape cannot
  sweep them back in; adding a row is a claim about what the game DOES,
  backed by log lines — never a way to quiet a noisy alert.
  **AND "NOT A HOLD" IS NOT "NOT AN ALERT"** (JOS-233): the SLOW group's
  mob-side roster claims both Largo's by name, and `NOT_A_HOLD` carries a
  `fires` column so a row states which group it ends up in and cannot drift
  silently between the two. Full story + the log evidence:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
- **THE CALM LINE IS A ROSTER TOO — AND ROUTING OBEYS RULING 8 (JOS-213).**
  Calm spells are Beneficial, so their timer landed in the player's BUFF
  overlay — while the thing they watch is a mob-state timer. The fix is a
  SECOND, orthogonal fact about the SPELL (`ActiveBuff.calmsTarget`,
  `spellCalmsTarget`, re-derived by an oracle every run, exactly like
  `ccSpell`); `cls` does NOT change. **THE CUT THAT FAILED IS THE LESSON**:
  routing on "the TARGET is a mob" reruns the error ruling 8
  (JOS-136/JOS-140) outlawed — nature, and now surface, comes from the
  spell, never from the shape of the target. Fixtures `w64`/`w65`, pinned in
  `tests/calmLineTimers.test.mts`; a pacified mob CAN be killed and takes
  the ordinary decrement-one death censor, never JOS-228's mez refusal.
  Full story: docs/agents-archive.md.
- **THE FRIEND SYSTEM ANNOUNCES NOTHING** (JOS-69): only the `/friends`
  roster print and the `<name> is now your friend.` confirmation exist — no
  login line, no logout line — so "a friend came online" is knowable only by
  polling, and the group ships hidden beside feign-death and pet-death.
  Sweep: docs/agents-archive.md.
- Motes (the Item Upgrade System's currency) arrive ONLY inside ordinary loot
  lines, which already parse to `loot { item, source }`; every one the items
  catalog knows is `Mote of <tier> Potential` (10 tiers, 7 seen: Infinitesimal
  220, Minor 31, Lesser 16, Major 8, Potential 7, Greater 2, Superior 1). Nothing
  anywhere RANKS the tiers, so a per-tier loot filter would be an invented fact.
- `LogEvent.raw` INCLUDES the `[timestamp] ` prefix: a `^`-anchored raw
  alert regex silently never matches — anchor on `\] ` (tripwire test).
- WorldModel labels append a spawn-generation ` (N)` suffix that appears
  in NO log line (law 2) — `mobKey` strips it.

## Data sources

- **Scraper etiquette (LAW)**: every scraping script must run at a
  respectful rate limit — **1 request per second minimum** (owner ruling
  2026-08-22, verbatim: *these are fan made servers, we don't need to be
  smashing concurrent scrape* — and the old 110ms cadence also dragged
  the owner's own machine while they were using it) — must **pull in bulk
  through the site's API where one exists** (same ruling: MediaWiki
  batched `prop=revisions` at the measured 50-page limit, `maxlag=5` so
  the server can refuse under load; the maxlag deferral arrives as HTTP
  200 with an error body + Retry-After, so it needs its own retry arm),
  honor backoffs (429/5xx → exponential retry, obey Retry-After), and be
  re-runnable + idempotent (cache hits skip the network; partial runs
  resume, never duplicate output). Applies to scripts/scrape-*,
  fetch-wiki-images, itemLookup, and any future fetcher.

- eqlwiki.com MediaWiki API (helper: `scripts/sources/eqlegends.ts`).
  Scrapers (output committed): `scrape:posky` (quest-item cells: iterate
  `<li>` items — `<br>`-splitting once dropped trailing unhinted items),
  `scrape:bosses` (curated list incl. efreeti spawn-chain "Other:" bosses),
  `scrape:spells`, `gen:message-overlay`, `gen:icon`.
- Item knowledge: `itemLookup.ts` — local-first (posky) → wiki
  `{{Itempage}}` (`statsblock` flags / `relatedquests` / `notes`), userData
  cache with negative caching, live-loot background prefetch.
- **THE WIKI ART SHIPS IN THE BOX, AND THE FETCH IS THE FALLBACK** (JOS-198,
  `src/main/bundledImages.ts` + `resources/wiki-images/`): every distinct
  item iconId + all 29 boss portraits (780 files, 3.75 MB), COMMITTED — a
  build-time fetch would make `npm run dist` depend on two volunteer wikis'
  uptime. `npm run fetch:images` regenerates them + `manifest.json`. Files
  are named by the cache's OWN `cacheFileName()`, so the bundle and
  `<userData>/image-cache` are ONE namespace that cannot drift;
  `bundledImageRoots` probes dev/e2e, `app.asar`, `app.asar.unpacked` in
  order. electron-builder names `resources/wiki-images/**` EXPLICITLY, never
  `resources/**`. A source build without images is a SUPPORTED state that
  falls back to the runtime cache. CREDIT IS PART OF THE FEATURE (both wikis
  named in-app + README). Pins: `tests/bundledImages.test.mts` re-hashes all
  780; `bosses-week.e2e.mts` proves cold userData + no network. Full story:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
- **Downloaded images are cached PERMANENTLY** (`src/main/imageCache.ts`): no
  image the app fetches may ever be fetched twice — and since JOS-198 a
  normal install fetches NONE. Item icons serve from `eqimg://item/<id>` (a
  `protocol.handle` on the DEFAULT session — one handler covers every
  window); a miss is ONE polite fetch, written ATOMICALLY and only if the
  bytes sniff as an image. NEGATIVES ARE NEVER CACHED **ON DISK** — a
  refusal IS remembered IN MEMORY, only when the HOST SPOKE; a NETWORK
  failure is DELIBERATELY NOT remembered. On disk: no TTL, no eviction. The
  second route, `eqimg://url/<encoded>`, has a STRICT host allowlist — exact
  `new URL().hostname` equality, https only; never substring/endsWith. Entry
  name = `url-<sha256[0:24]>.<sniffed ext>`. **`img-src` does NOT list
  `https:`** (exactly `'self' data: eqimg:`): that is what makes "every
  downloaded image is cached" structurally true — widening the CSP is never
  the fix; wrap the URL through the `url` route. Full story:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
- Sound packs: og-packs registry (peonping.github.io/registry) —
  browse/install ~350 packs in-app. The single shipped default
  (`alan-rickman`, pinned tag) is GITIGNORED audio, self-provisioned via the
  same installPack path (additive, retried with backoff — and since JOS-273
  honouring the tombstone and the default-pack preference above). The
  synthesized `default` chime pack is DELETED; alerts pointing at any
  retired pack were rewritten by a ONE-TIME store migration
  (`migrateAlertSounds`), so an upgrading user's alerts never go silently
  mute. Pickers pre-select through the preference (`fallbackPack`), never
  `packs[0]`.
- **BRING YOUR OWN SOUND (JOS-68): `my-sounds` is a RESERVED pack with its own
  ROOT.** The user's imports live in `<userData>/my-sounds/` (the ordinary
  pack shape), NOT under `soundpacks/` — the sibling root makes a registry
  collision UNREPRESENTABLE rather than unlikely (`packDir()` resolves the
  reserved id FIRST, `installPack` refuses the name). **The file is COPIED,
  and the id BECOMES the filename** (`userSoundId()`: lowercase slug, capped,
  de-duped), so a moved original can never mute an alert and no byte of
  user-supplied path text reaches `join()`. The picker is
  `dialog.showOpenDialog` in MAIN — no absolute path crosses IPC in either
  direction; serving goes through the same `sounds:getData` + `isSafePackId`
  door as every pack, never a second one. **A missing custom sound is NOT
  silence** (falls back to the shipped default's line). Removal WARNS by
  naming the alerts that play it and leaves their defs ALONE. Identity /
  formats / the 25 MB cap: `shared/userSounds.ts`; the file work takes its
  ROOT as an argument (tests/userSounds.test.mts drives real copies in a
  temp dir). Full story: docs/agents-archive.md.

## UI conventions

- **NO EM DASHES IN USER-FACING COPY (owner, 2026-08-08 — JOS-106).** Every
  string a player can read uses a NORMAL dash with spaces (` - `), never
  U+2014 (—) or U+2013 (–) — renderer strings, overlay text, tooltips,
  preferences captions, empty states, alert/group copy, and
  `shared/releaseNotes.ts` (historical entries render in the What's-new
  panel, so they are copy too, not an archive). Where a dash reads badly,
  RESTRUCTURE instead of substituting. The GLYPH AS A DATA PLACEHOLDER is
  held to the same rule (`-`, or a short label — `UNSTATED_AMOUNT`). This is
  about COPY, not the tree: code comments and this file's prose keep their em
  dashes. `tests/copyNoEmDash.test.mts` is the guard; its header states
  exactly what it covers, and its two technical exclusions are listed in the
  test.
- **SAY WHAT THE LOG DID, NOT WHAT WE DID TO THE NUMBER (JOS-106).** A label
  describing our own bookkeeping reads as a defect to the person holding it —
  Mend's by-design `unvalued` tag was filed as a BUG inside a day. It is now
  `no amount`: one plain phrase, single-sourced from `UNSTATED_AMOUNT`
  (healRows.ts) so the panel/overlay/hover cannot drift, said ONCE per row;
  the long form stays in the hover title, never a caption.
- **State, never process**: no methodology captions, no script references,
  no how-it-works panels. Chips convey state (db/observed, permanent,
  inferred, casting…, ~ambiguous).
- **TOOLTIP AND CAVEAT DIET (owner, 2026-08-05).** The UI does the talking;
  player experience fills the rest. Tooltips are for enabling an action or
  naming a control — one clause, no caveats, never on an input the user types
  into. Do not footnote where a number came from or how it might be wrong;
  when stated-vs-inferred genuinely matters, one word ('est.', the existing
  chips) beats a sentence. TEACHING is welcome when it is collaborative —
  a dismissible explainer that helps someone use a feature successfully (the
  planner's exaltation card is the model) — never defensive source-caveating.
  When in doubt: delete the tooltip and let the label earn its keep.
- **BACK MEANS WHERE YOU CAME FROM, and there is ONE mechanism for it**
  (JOS-43). Every cross-view link funnels through the `useAppRouting`
  openers, so the navigation-origin STACK lives at that seam (`navOrigin.ts`
  + `useNavSeam`). An ANCHORED link parks the tab it leaves; a BARE opener,
  MANUAL navigation, or a NATIVE drill clears. NEVER add a per-view
  `cameFrom` prop: five of those are five opinions about what Back means. A
  back affordance NAMES ITS DESTINATION. Session-lifetime only.
  **AND THE MOUSE'S BACK BUTTON PRESSES THE AFFORDANCE THAT IS ON SCREEN**
  (JOS-201): `backTargets.ts` — the innermost REGISTERED affordance wins,
  `nav.back()` is the fallback slot, and each drill registers *the same
  expression its own button runs* (`useBackTarget`). The input is a
  BrowserWindow `app-command` listener on the MAIN window only, gated on
  focus — no globalShortcut, no mouse hook, nothing while EverQuest is
  foreground; `browser-forward` is deliberately unhandled. (Chromium handles
  the physical X-button in the browser process — a DOM listener would not
  work.) Full story: docs/agents-archive.md.
- **A VIEW UNMOUNTS ON EVERY TAB SWITCH, so `useState` in one is a promise you
  cannot keep** (JOS-90, JOS-97, JOS-116 — the same bug three times).
  Anything the user set on purpose goes in a renderer pref (`eq.<feature>.*`
  in localStorage, the `useCombatPrefs` idiom) or above the switch boundary.
  Two traps, both paid for: **an effect cannot tell a click from a mount** —
  the reset belongs on the CHANGE HANDLER; and a stored value must DEGRADE
  rather than error (JOS-105). Prove it with a spec that actually navigates
  and asserts the view was GONE first (sky-filters is the template); a unit
  test of the read passes while the feature stays broken.
- Search: input echoes instantly; filter on `useDeferredValue`; lowercase
  `searchKey` computed once per data change; long fixed-height lists
  windowed via `lib/useWindowedRows`, variable-height cap+paginate. These
  surfaces are RENDER-bound (<1ms compute) — no workers/DBs.
- Formatting: rates `21.7k dps` / `2.3M dps` (word 'dps' after number, k/M
  scaling); totals keep k/M with NO unit word. ONE source: `lib/formatRate`
  (`formatRate`/`formatNum`) — every meter/overlay/drill-down/tooltip uses it,
  NO `/s` anywhere (Task #54 sweep). Dates/times through `lib/formatDate`
  (user-local; never UTC or epoch-day math). Tier chips via `lib/tierChip`
  (dark fg on tier bg, WCAG AA).
- **A growing list lives in a FIXED-height scroll box.** The app's content
  area is `overflow:auto`, so `height:100%` clamps nothing and a
  `flex: 0 0 auto` panel sizes to its content and squeezes its siblings to
  0px. Any append-only panel gets an explicit height + its own
  `overflow:auto`; the panel that must survive gets `flexGrow:1` +
  `minHeight:0`. Verified by the headless e2e harness, which measures it.
  CARVE-OUT (owner directive 2026-08-13, JOS-289): the LEVELING tab is one
  naturally-tall page the app shell scrolls — panels take honest heights,
  and a list is windowed/capped there only when measured row counts demand
  it (drops: 641 distinct names, generous ceiling; spell readout: max 41
  rows, unwindowed). Bounded lists elsewhere keep the law.
- **Hydration is a state, and the UI must show it.** During the startup replay
  every snapshot describes the PAST (an hours-old fight is `current`).
  `CombatSnapshot.hydrating` (engine: true until `setLive()`) gates a quiet
  "Reading log…" placeholder in CombatView + the overlay meter — never a
  churning fake-live meter. Task #56.
- **Fight vs Overall is an explicit SCOPE, never an automatic switch.** A
  `Fight | Overall` toggle (sibling of Dashboard/Timeline, Outgoing/Incoming;
  persisted `eq.combat.scope`) drives one filter — `scopeOptions()` in
  dashboardData.ts, shared by the main view AND every overlay kind, so a fight
  meter can never show zone data. Fight scope keeps the LAST fight on screen
  between pulls (auto-swapping to the zone aggregate was rejected: it moved the
  ground under you mid-session) but LABELS it honestly — head row reads
  "Current fight (live)" only while a pull is open, else "Last fight — <name>",
  and a locked overlay (no selector) tags its header `· LAST`. The head row's
  VALUE stays the `__live__` sentinel so it re-resolves each tick. No fights at
  all ⇒ quiet empty state, never borrowed zone data. `liveFallback` is GONE.
- Celebrations (confetti/sound) fire EXACTLY ONCE PER LIVE TRANSITION;
  hydration seeds a silent baseline; manual actions never celebrate.
  **THE SILENT BASELINE ONLY HOLDS IF A SWITCH DELIVERS A SNAPSHOT AND NEVER
  A DELTA** (JOS-60): one pre-`log:character` delta carrying the incoming
  character's history is read as news and celebrates all of it — never fix
  this class of bug with a wall-clock suppression window; the cause is a
  delta that should not exist, and the cure is not sending it. "Once per
  transition", never "once ever": a REPEAT boss kill is a transition (owner:
  "every time is worth celebrating"); rate limiting belongs to the alert's
  own cooldown. And EVERY kill means every kill CREDITED TO YOU (owner): the
  credit test is the log's own exp line joined to the slain line
  (`KillTierRun.credited`, `KILL_EXP_JOIN_MS`) — a group-mate's blow counts
  (party exp is exp), a passer-by's does not; `bossKills` still counts every
  defeat, credit gates celebration alone. Full story: docs/agents-archive.md.

- **TWO TEXT SIZES, AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS ON PURPOSE (JOS-123).**
  The MAIN window scales with an Electron ZOOM FACTOR (`shared/uiScale.ts`:
  the five-stop ladder + a normalizer that SNAPS to it; persisted top-level
  `uiScale`, absent reads as 1 so an upgrade resizes nobody; applied at
  window CONSTRUCTION, and the IPC setter zooms the live window in the same
  call it stores). The OVERLAYS keep their own per-kind `textScale`, a CSS
  `zoom` on the CONTENT PANE only (chrome unscaled, overlayScale.tsx) — an
  overlay's header/footer must keep laying out against the real window
  width — and the two must not be merged: the main window is never given a
  `textScale`, no overlay window a `zoomFactor`. `tests/uiScale.test.mts`
  pins both halves; `text-size.e2e.mts` proves it over two real launches.
  The accessors live in `src/main/uiScale.ts` because store.ts is AT the
  400-line ceiling — a door for moving reads out, never a licence to skip a
  normalizer.

- **A COLOUR A USER PICKS IS A VALUE THAT REACHES A STYLE PROPERTY (JOS-125).**
  `normalizeRingColor` accepts `#rgb` / `#rrggbb` AND NOTHING ELSE — the
  value ends up in `element.style.borderColor`, so `red`, `rgb()`, `var(--x)`
  and anything carrying a `;` are refused (costs nothing:
  `<input type="color">` cannot produce them; buys: a store file can never
  write a CSS declaration). ONE function turns the hex into the drawn colour
  (`ringStrokeColor`), read by all three drawings and pinned by
  `tests/cursorRingColor.test.mts` so they cannot drift. The alpha and
  shadows are NOT settings — a player asking for a colour is not asking for
  less contrast. Default white exactly, so an upgrade recolours nobody.

## Shipping

- CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) runs `npm test` — the FULL
  golden-window suite (fixtures are committed; only full-log tests skip
  there). **Publish on tags ONLY** (reworked 2026-08-03; the per-push
  prerelease spam is gone): push to main → typecheck/test/build, installer
  as CI artifact, nothing published; tag `v*` → the one publish path, with
  the version STAMPED FROM THE TAG in CI (package.json never carries it).
  Release process: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
- **A TAG MAY NOT SHIP WITHOUT RELEASE NOTES** (JOS-73).
  `src/shared/releaseNotes.ts` is committed source read by the What's-new
  panel, so a missing entry is not a crash, it is SILENCE. The tag job runs
  `scripts/check-release-notes.mjs`, which refuses a tag with no entry
  (same shape check as `tests/releaseNotes.test.mts`). Write the entry
  BEFORE tagging. **WHO WRITES IT: THE INTEGRATOR, AT RELEASE CUT (owner
  rule 2026-08-10).** Notes are a release-driven activity; worker branches
  never touch `releaseNotes.ts` — the integrator drafts the whole entry from
  the release's merged tickets when the tag is cut. Full story:
  docs/agents-archive.md. **A NOTE IS SHORT (owner, 2026-09-03):** at most
  three sentences — what the player sees now, optionally why it was wrong,
  optionally what changed in a clause; a second visible thing is a second
  bullet. The shape rules live in the file header and
  `tests/releaseNotes.test.mts` enforces the ceiling.
- **RELEASE CADENCE: tag only when the user asks, or at a clearly STABLE
  point** — features verified end-to-end, the gauntlet green, no waves in
  flight. Commits land on main continuously; a tag is a deliberate act,
  never an automatic one and never mid-wave. When in doubt, don't tag —
  the next stable point is never far.
- **main.yml BRIDGE (do not remove)**: every install to date polls the
  'main' channel feed, and a stable release natively writes only latest.yml,
  so the tag job uploads a copy as main.yml on the same release — old
  main-channel installs step up to stables instead of stalling forever.
  Azure Trusted Signing wiring is inert until 6 `AZURE_*` repo secrets
  exist (account `jmoyers-eqtools`, deliberately not renamed).
- **`npm ci` DOES NOT INSTALL ELECTRON'S BINARY ANY MORE.** `.npmrc` sets
  `ignore-scripts=true` (no dependency's install hook executes — the npm
  compromise vector), so after any `npm ci` / `npm install` you MUST run
  `npm run deps:electron` or dev/dist fails. Electron is the ONE package
  needing its hook; both CI jobs run it as an explicit step. Explicit
  `npm run <x>` is unaffected; only lifecycle hooks are.
- **build.yml is TWO JOBS and that is a security boundary**: `build` (non-tag
  refs, `contents: read`) and `release` (tag refs, `contents: write`). Token
  permissions are per-job and static, so one job covering both paths had to
  hold write on every push to main. Keep the two preludes in sync; never
  merge them back into one job. All `uses:` are pinned to commit SHAs (a
  `@v4` tag is mutable) — re-resolve with
  `gh api repos/<o>/<a>/git/ref/tags/<t> --jq .object.sha` when bumping.
  Tagged releases also publish `SHA256SUMS.txt` alongside the installer.
- **Unsigned build ⇒ the GitHub account IS the trust root.** electron-updater
  verifies the sha512 from the feed (so a tampered *download* fails), but with
  no Authenticode publisher it cannot verify *who* built the release. Anyone
  who can publish a release here can ship a silent, per-user, no-UAC update to
  every install. Azure signing closes this (`verifyUpdateCodeSignature` turns
  on for signed Windows builds); until then, tag/release access is the control.
  See `SECURITY.md`, which states this plainly to users.
### Installer architecture

- Build chain: `npm run dist` = `electron-vite build` → electron-builder
  NSIS (`electron-builder.yml`). **Per-user install is load-bearing**:
  `oneClick:true, perMachine:false` installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs`
  with NO UAC ever — which is what lets electron-updater silently
  self-install and relaunch (the Discord model). Never flip perMachine.
- **THE ENGINE SHIPS SIGNED, AND THE MATCHER SHAPE IS WHAT SIGNS IT (JOS-473).**
  `npm run build:engine` (`scripts/build-engine.mts`, the repo's one cargo-path
  resolution) builds `engined.exe` RELEASE; `extraResources` copies it to
  `resources/engine/engined.exe` — outside the asar, where a native exe can
  actually be launched, and the first packaged path `engineBinaryCandidates`
  probes. **A `from:` naming the FILE would ship it unsigned**: app-builder-lib
  hands the sign transformer to `copyFiles`' DIRECTORY branch only, so the entry
  is a directory plus a one-name filter. A missing binary is a WARNING there, not
  an error, which is why `build:engine` asserts the file exists and why both
  packaging jobs run it. `tests/enginePackaging.test.mts` pins all of it.
- **Windows 10+ gate** (`customInit` in `build/installer.nsh`, JOS-32):
  `${IfNot} ${AtLeastWin10}` → one-sentence MessageBox + `Quit` (Electron
  dropped Win7/8 at v23). `customInit`, NOT `preInit` — preInit would also
  gate the uninstaller-writing pass and the uninstaller itself. **The version
  lie is the trap**: `GetVersionEx` reports 6.2 to an unmanifested process,
  and only NSIS 3's default `ManifestSupportedOS` lets the truth through —
  VERIFIED by compiling a probe; re-run it if electron-builder ever sets
  ManifestSupportedOS. `/SD IDOK` so a `/S` run refuses without blocking.
  Full story: docs/agents-archive.md.
- **Add/Remove Programs**: the entry lives at
  `HKCU\...\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\<UUIDv5(appId)>` — keyed by GUID, so
  grep by DisplayName. app-builder-lib writes it unconditionally but puts
  InstallLocation only in `HKCU\Software\<guid>`, so `customInstall` in
  `build/installer.nsh` mirrors it. That file is included at the TOP of the
  generated .nsi, BEFORE multiUser.nsh defines `UNINSTALL_REGISTRY_KEY` —
  spell the path from `UNINSTALL_APP_KEY` (a `-D` define, always present);
  the not-yet-defined one compiles fine and dies instantly with 0xC0000005.
  Full story: docs/agents-archive.md.
- **An installed app with files but NO uninstall entry is a RACE, not a build
  bug.** The uninstaller does `RMDir /r $INSTDIR` first and `DeleteRegKey` LAST,
  and an NSIS uninstaller launched without `_?=` relaunches itself from %TEMP%
  and the process you waited on exits IMMEDIATELY. So tier-1's
  `Uninstall*.exe /S` + an immediate reinstall lets the detached tail delete the
  keys the reinstall just wrote. Never reinstall after an uninstall without
  POLLING for the install dir and the uninstall key to disappear.
- **Uninstall asks before discarding user data.** `deleteAppDataOnUninstall`
  stays `false`; the ONLY deletion path is `customUnInstall` in
  `build/installer.nsh`, which prompts "Keep your settings and history?"
  (Yes = default = keep) and only on No does `RMDir /r "$APPDATA\everquest-companion"`.
  A `/S` uninstall NEVER prompts and ALWAYS preserves — that is the contract the
  sandbox harness and every scripted uninstall rely on. It must never widen to
  `%APPDATA%\eq-tools` (the pre-rename backup the one-time seed reads) or
  `%APPDATA%\everquest-companion-dev` (the running dev app). Gotcha: `${Silent}`
  is USELESS for that test — oneClick's `un.onInit` calls `SetSilent silent`
  after its own confirm dialog, so the section always sees silent; detect the real
  `/S` from `${GetParameters}`/`${GetOptions}` instead.
- Exe branding: `signAndEditExecutable:true` needs the winCodeSign cache —
  run `scripts/seed-wincodesign.ps1` once per machine. Icon via `gen:icon`.
- Publish: `publish: github jmoyers/everquest-companion`; installer +
  `.blockmap` + `latest*.yml` feeds under `release/<version>/`. Unsigned for
  now (SmartScreen "More info → Run anyway" in README); Azure signing turns
  on via repo secrets only — CI args are already conditional.
- Auto-update: electron-updater in `src/main/updater.ts` — channel from
  store; check at +10s then 30min; toast → quitAndInstall; dev-guarded on
  `app.isPackaged` EXCEPT channel IPC (settings UI needs it in dev).
- First-run self-sufficiency: the default sound pack self-provisions from
  its pinned registry tag; spell DB/overlay baseline inlined in the main
  bundle; EQ dir resolves via env → registry → drive-sweep with the
  Settings-gear override; zero logs anywhere → quiet empty state, never an
  error. Full detail: docs/agents-archive.md.
- **DISCOVERY SPAWNS NOTHING, AND THAT IS AN AV DECISION AS MUCH AS A SPEED ONE
  (JOS-184).** `src/main/log/discovery.ts` used to shell out (eight `reg.exe`
  queries + `wmic`); both reads now go in-process through `native-reg`
  (~150 ms of blocked main thread → ~6 ms, and no AV heuristic signature).
  Two invariants pinned by `tests/eqDiscovery.test.mts`: `eqInstallPathValue`
  reproduces the OLD command's contract exactly, and `fixedDrives` reads
  `HKLM\SYSTEM\MountedDevices` (mapped NETWORK drives are never there — the
  property that keeps the offline-share hang fixed). `native-reg` ships its
  N-API prebuild INSIDE the tarball; it is `require`d LAZILY and its failure
  swallowed — a bad `.node` must cost one of three discovery paths, not the
  launch. Full story: docs/agents-archive.md.

### Product identity + channel isolation (Task #58)

- ONE name everywhere: `everquest-companion` (package name, appId, installer,
  install dir, store file, log prefixes, scraper UAs); the DISPLAY name
  stays "EQ Legends Companion". `eq-tools` survives ONLY as the
  legacy-migration source. NSIS install dir + updater cache derive from
  package.json `name`, NOT productName. Full inventory:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
- Channels are decided in `src/main/channel.ts`, the FIRST import of
  index.ts (it must run before electron-store is constructed at module
  scope). Nothing else in the tree hardcodes a userData path — soundpacks,
  errors.log, item/registry caches and the learned overlay all resolve
  through `app.getPath('userData')`, so redirecting the root redirects
  everything:

  | channel | when | userData |
  |---|---|---|
  | prod | `app.isPackaged` | `%APPDATA%\everquest-companion` |
  | dev | not packaged | `%APPDATA%\everquest-companion-dev` |
  | e2e | `EQ_E2E=1` | temp dir (`EQ_E2E_USER_DATA` or `mkdtemp`) |

- Separate dirs ⇒ separate single-instance locks (Chromium keys
  ProcessSingleton off the user-data dir), so the installed app and the dev
  app genuinely run at the same time — verified with two Electron processes
  that both won `requestSingleInstanceLock()` on different dirs and where
  the second lost on a shared dir. Never "fix" a second instance quitting by
  weakening the lock; check the channel first.
- ONE-TIME SEED (prod + dev, never e2e): if the channel's dir does not exist
  and `%APPDATA%\eq-tools` does, an allowlist is COPIED and a
  `migrated-from.json` stamp written; Chromium caches / lockfile / errors.log
  deliberately skipped; the old dir is never modified — it's the backup.
  Guard is "target dir absent" so it can't run twice; failures log and
  startup continues. **UPDATE CONTINUITY BREAK (conscious)**: the rename
  means per-user NSIS sees a NEW app — an old `eq-tools` install never
  chain-updates; the user uninstalls once and state carries via the seed
  (documented in README). Allowlist + detail: docs/agents-archive.md.

### Settings migrations (persisted store schema)

- **LAW: any commit that changes a persisted shape ships a migration in the
  SAME commit.** Bump `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` in
  `src/main/storeMigrations.ts`, append a step to `MIGRATIONS`, add a fixture.
  That rule is the whole reason "an upgrade is clean, going back indefinitely"
  can be true: a store written by ANY past build must load in today's build,
  and auto-update means users jump many versions at once. `MIGRATIONS` is
  APPEND-ONLY — never renumber, edit a shipped step, or delete one.
- An explicit integer `schemaVersion` INSIDE the file, not app semver: CI
  stamps versions from tags and dev runs unstamped, so electron-store's
  semver-keyed `migrations` fire in surprising orders across channels. Absent
  ⇒ 1 (every pre-framework store), and the chain runs 1→2→…→CURRENT.
- Runs ONCE at startup from store.ts module scope, BEFORE `new Store()`, so no
  reader ever sees a pre-migration shape — and after channel.ts's one-time
  `eq-tools` seed (store.ts imports channel.ts first). Ad-hoc fixups in read
  paths are the anti-pattern it replaces: the flat `overlay` →
  `overlays.fight` fold moved out of `getOverlayConfig()` into migration 1→2.
  (`alertSoundMigration` predates the framework and keeps its own stamp — its
  "respect a user who re-points an alert" semantics aren't schema-shaped.)
- Migration 1→2 is REAL work, not a dormant no-op: it also recovers the
  `progress` blob commit 41831cc orphaned (salvaged under
  `legacy:pre-character` only when no real character exists — never guess an
  owner) and drops the dead `liveLoot` map.
- **Startup never dies here.** Unreadable ⇒ untouched, unstamped. Unparseable
  ⇒ QUARANTINED to `<name>.corrupt.json` and start fresh (conf leaves
  `clearInvalidConfig` false, so one truncated write otherwise throws on every
  read forever). A step that throws ⇒ keep what succeeded, stamp the last
  version that fully landed, retry next launch. Before the first write the
  original bytes are copied to `<name>.v<from>.backup.json`, once per source
  version (a later run never overwrites the pristine copy).
- **Downgrade (file newer than the build)**: log, back up, and leave the file
  ALONE — no down-migration, no reset, no stamping backwards. The old build
  runs best-effort, which is safe because every reader defaults on a missing
  key and electron-store rewrites the whole parsed object, so future keys
  survive round-trips. Verified by `tests/storeMigrations.test.mts`, which
  drives the pure runner + the file half with authored fixtures of the real
  historical shapes (no Electron, never skips).

### Installer testing strategy (three tiers)

1. **Local self-test** (any dev machine, no elevation): Setup exe `/S` →
   assert files/shortcut/branding; launch (the installed app has its OWN
   userData + lock, so it opens BESIDE a running dev app — that's the PASS);
   `Uninstall*.exe /S` → assert cleanup, appData preserved. Cheap smoke for
   every dist build.
2. **Windows Sandbox** — the REAL clean-machine test: disposable pristine VM,
   maps `release/` read-only + a results folder; LogonCommand silently
   installs, verifies files/shortcut/ARP registration/process-start AND the
   fresh-machine experience (no EQ installed → the zero-logs empty state),
   uninstalls, asserts files AND the uninstall key are gone, writes
   PASS/FAIL. 19 checks; `arp-*` names each ARP field individually.
   **Invoke via `scripts/sandbox/run-installer-test.ps1`** (never the raw
   .wsb) — it owns the whole lifecycle (one VM machine-wide, current Setup
   exe required, VM parked off the primary monitor, exits 0/1); the harness
   invariants (ASCII-only for the guest's ANSI PS 5.1, verdict from a
   `finally`, POLL after uninstall) are stated in the script. Requires the
   `Containers-DisposableClientVM` feature. Full detail:
   docs/agents-archive.md.
3. **Docker servercore** (`scripts/docker/`) — headless file-level fallback:
   silent install + file/ARP-registry verification only; throws on first
   failure. Use when Sandbox isn't available.

Always test the CURRENT `npm run dist` output, not a stale release/ exe — a
clean-machine pass on an old build proves nothing about today's first-run
provisioning.

### Post-release feedback smoke test (`npm run smoke:release`)

ON-DEMAND ONLY — not in CI, not in `npm test`, not in `test:e2e`. Run once
after a release publishes: a sandbox DOWNLOADS the published installer
(verified against `SHA256SUMS.txt`), plants a mocked EQ log, launches the
installed app with `EQ_SMOKE_FEEDBACK=<nonce>`, and
`src/main/smokeFeedback.ts` files ONE real bug report through the ordinary
`submitFeedback` path (NO endpoint override, refused under `EQ_E2E`). The
host half reads the LIVE backlog and asserts the row, the slice upgrading
to `present`, and — the point — that the slice CONTAINS the run's nonce and
does NOT contain `CHAT_MARKER`: the scrub proof, measured on the bytes that
made the round trip. A `closed` answer is its OWN verdict (kill switch on,
plumbing proven). Reuses the tier-2 lifecycle via
`scripts/sandbox/sandbox-lifecycle.ps1`.
- Overlay: Electron suffices for windowed/borderless EQ; exclusive
  fullscreen cannot be overlaid by anything (native-helper escape hatch:
  feed it the same snapshot IPC) — but the live client HAS no exclusive
  mode: its own Fullscreen setting is a BORDERLESS fullscreen window
  (owner-verified, JOS-375), so the escape hatch has never been needed and
  the telemetry member is named `fullscreen`, not `exclusive`. ONE
  overlay.html bundle, kind read from
  `?kind=`; each kind has its own persisted config (`store overlays.<kind>`)
  and can run simultaneously; all overlay IPC channels take the kind as
  first arg. Interactive mode adds a dense selector + a mini drill-down;
  locked mode stays fully click-through but RENDERS the persisted drill
  read-only (`overlays.<kind>.drill` — config IS the drill state; stale ids
  render level 1 without clearing). EIGHT kinds: fight/overall (damage),
  heal-fight/heal-overall, events, buffs + debuffs (JOS-89/JOS-119 —
  below), and toast (celebration cards — docs/plans/celebration-toasts.md).
  The toast is the ONE kind that defaults OPEN (owner, 2026-08-05; schema
  v9 corrects stores written at the old default) and has NO SOUND of its
  own — the seeded boss/quest ALERTS speak on the same events.
- **SCROLLING AND CLICK-THROUGH CANNOT BOTH BE TRUE OF THE SAME PIXEL (JOS-138).**
  Pinned is `setIgnoreMouseEvents(true, {forward:true})`, and `forward`
  forwards mouse MOVES and nothing else — a wheel notch goes to the game.
  The owner's disposition ("we should allow scroll") is paid for in pixels:
  the **SCROLL GRIP** (`SCROLL_GRIP_W`, overlay/overlayScale.tsx) is a 22px
  strip over the drawn scrollbar; while LOCKED *and* the rows genuinely
  overflow, a forwarded move inside it takes the mouse for exactly the time
  the pointer spends there — the wheel AND dragging the bar, because the
  grip hands the real scrollbar real events. NO new IPC, NO new mouse hook;
  the rest of the body stays genuinely click-through (asserted in
  `tests/e2e/overlayScrollSteps.mts`). The event log and buffs/debuffs
  windows hold capture over their WHOLE window while hovered — the same
  trade at the other extreme. Honest limits + full story:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
- **THE OVERLAY FLOOR IS ONE RECTANGLE, AND IT IS MEASURED (JOS-278).**
  `OVERLAY_MIN_SIZE` in `overlayLayout.ts` (140x90) is the minimum for EVERY
  kind — never per-kind (the busiest chrome is what the number must survive),
  and it exists so a window can never be dragged tiny and lost. **Do not change
  this number from a constant — change it from a measurement**
  (tests/e2e/overlayMinSizeSteps.mts is the instrument). Full measurement
  story: docs/agents-archive.md.
- **THE BUFF/TIMER OVERLAY'S BAR IS A CLAIM, AND ITS ABSENCE IS THE HONEST HALF**
  (JOS-89, docs/plans/buff-timer-overlay.md). ONE law decides every row: **a
  duration `spells.json` STATES becomes a receding countdown; a duration
  nobody states becomes ELAPSED time counting UP; there is no third case.**
  An unknown-duration row has NO BAR and a `+` before its time; the mined
  `observed` estimate is NOT a stated duration (`durationSource === 'db'` is
  the whole discriminator). `modules/buffTimers.ts` owns per-target holds
  keyed by mob; everything else reads off `BuffsSnap.active` (a second fold
  is the two-models scar law 4 is made of); candidates narrow by YOUR OWN
  CAST HISTORY (law 3), and a broadcast with no own cast opens NO hold. A
  KNOWN GAP, deliberately not fixed here: a CC-roster wear-off never reaches
  `onBuffFade`, so the overlay corrects it in its own projection
  (`endedByCc`). Selectors are scope-filtered custom `OverlaySelect` (the
  overlay bundle stays MUI-free by law); PERSISTED bounds always win. Full
  story: docs/agents-archive.md.
- **A HIDDEN WINDOW CANNOT PAINT, SO `hide()` IS NEVER HOW YOU CLEAR ONE
  (JOS-120).** A hidden `BrowserWindow` produces no frames and `show()`
  re-presents its last composited surface — an IPC "clear" sent after
  `hide()` is recorded and never drawn. Two rules: **(a) Clear BEFORE you
  hide** (`suspendCursorStream`); **(b) better, do not hide for a state you
  will leave in a few hundred ms** — `ringDisposition` (replayGate.ts)
  splits `idle` (really come off the screen) from `parked` (empty the halo
  and LEAVE THE WINDOW VISIBLE). The second half of the same bug was a
  CADENCE RATIO: **whenever a poll GATES a faster consumer, the number that
  matters is the ratio, not either period**
  (`unguardedSamplesPerHiddenCursor`). `tests/cursorRingClick.test.mts`
  models all four clocks and reproduces the twitch on the old path first.
  Full story + measurements: docs/agents-archive.md.
- **…AND THE LOOP THAT DROVE ALL OF IT NO LONGER SPAWNS ANYTHING (JOS-182).**
  The presence watcher was a hidden `powershell.exe` with runtime `Add-Type`
  — an infostealer signature to a behavioural AV engine, and it never ran at
  all on 578 installs' machines (`spawn ENOENT`, fail-open). It is now a
  **worker thread** calling user32/kernel32/psapi through **koffi**. Three
  rules, all general:
  - **A NATIVE DEPENDENCY HERE MUST SHIP PREBUILT N-API BINARIES IN ITS NPM
    TARBALL** (`.npmrc` ignores install scripts, `npmRebuild` is false). Pin
    koffi **2.x** — 3.x downloads prebuilds in its install hook.
  - **NEVER `worker.terminate()` A THREAD THAT CALLS NATIVE CODE** —
    MEASURED: terminating inside a koffi call aborts the whole process, no
    catch anywhere. Ask it to stop over the port; a `'message'` handler runs
    only BETWEEN ticks.
  - **MOVING WORK OFF A PROCESS IS NOT THE SAME AS MOVING IT ONTO MAIN** —
    the child's one virtue was being somewhere else. Keep that, drop the
    process. (Same argument as `speechWorker`; both are separate rollup
    inputs because `new Worker(path)` loads a FILE.)
  Full story: docs/agents-archive.md.
- **…AND IT IS TWO WINDOWS, OVER ONE MODEL (JOS-119).** The one 'buffs' kind
  became 'buffs' + 'debuffs' — two configs, two windows, two toggles. **THE
  SPLIT IS A FILTER, NOT A FORK**: `buildTimerRows` still folds the models
  exactly once and `shared/buffTimers.ts timerRowSurface` routes each row by
  its own `kind` (`group` is deliberately NOT the discriminator). ONE
  component (`BuffsOverlay.tsx` + a `kind` prop). NO MIGRATION by design:
  `overlays.buffs` keeps its key so bounds carry over; `overlays.debuffs`
  arrives OFF. The uniform first-open size is a FUNCTION OF THE DISPLAY (a
  fixed shrink ladder; 1080p+ untouched). One measured e2e gotcha to keep: a
  programmatic `setBounds` from MAIN raises no `moved`/`resized` — a
  persistence spec must write through `overlay:setConfig`. Full story:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
- **GRAPHICS COMPATIBILITY IS TWO SWITCHES, AND NEITHER IS INSTANT (JOS-40).**
  `shared/graphicsPrefs.ts` (store `graphics`, both default 'auto' — a
  compatibility mode shipped ON is a downgrade for every machine that never
  needed one; `auto` resolves OFF where nothing is detected). (a) SAFE MODE:
  `app.disableHardwareAcceleration()` from index.ts MODULE SCOPE (Electron
  accepts it only before `ready` — hence "next launch", and moving it into
  `whenReady` would silently do nothing); `EQ_DISABLE_GPU=1` forces it for
  one launch and outranks everything. (b) OPAQUE OVERLAYS:
  `transparent:false` on `OPAQUE_OVERLAY_BG` (the pages' own RGB minus the
  alpha, never a second palette); transparency is fixed at construction ⇒
  applies on the next overlay OPEN; the TOAST is shown only while it has a
  card (driven off `overlay:setIgnoreMouse`, never a second timer); the
  cursor ring is NEVER opaque. Neither switch joins the shared settings
  profile — they describe one machine's driver. Proven end-to-end in
  `tests/e2e/overlay-sync.e2e.mts`. Full story: docs/agents-archive.md.
- **…AND UNDER WINE THE APP COMPENSATES BY ITSELF (JOS-31).** The
  switches are THREE-STATE (`'auto' | 'on' | 'off'`, store v11) and
  `shared/wineDetect.ts` decides what `auto` means. **PRECEDENCE, one
  function, three rungs**: `EQ_DISABLE_GPU` > an explicit user choice >
  detection > off; `resolveGraphics` is the ONLY place that folds them.
  **DETECTION IS CONSERVATIVE OR IT IS NOTHING** — a false positive costs
  EVERY Windows user their GPU. Two signals, either sufficient, both
  impossible on real Windows: Wine's own tools in `system32` (exact
  filenames, never a `wine*` pattern), and the env vars Wine's own ntdll
  injects (WINEHOMEDIR et al — NOT `WINEPREFIX`, which is launcher-set).
  Gated on `platform === 'win32'`. The 10→11 migration reads a stored
  `false` as 'auto' and `true` as 'on'. Rejected signals and why:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
- **AND THE CONCLUSION IT DREW WAS BACKWARDS: SAFE MODE IS THE ONE PATH WINE
  CANNOT DO (JOS-352, GitHub issue 28 — the first Wine measurement this repo
  has ever had).** JOS-31 shipped unverified and the report inverted it:
  `disableHardwareAcceleration()` on Windows does not mean "no GPU", it pins
  ANGLE to **D3D11 WARP**, a Microsoft binary Wine does not implement, so the
  compatibility path was the only one that could not paint (white client area;
  `eglInitialize D3D11Warp failed`, `all (1) EGL display types failed`) while
  hardware D3D11 works in a modern bottle. `WINE_GRAPHICS_AUTO` is
  `{safeMode:false, opaqueOverlays:true}` now, and the hardware path is paid
  for with two Chromium flags — `WINE_CHROMIUM_FLAGS` =
  `--disable-direct-composition` (DComp is `E_NOTIMPL`) and `--in-process-gpu`
  (the GPU process takes a `0xC0000005` in init that DComp is NOT the cause
  of), appended before `ready` by `applyGraphicsCompatibilityFlags()`. GATED ON
  THE DETECTION, NEVER ON A PREFERENCE — `--in-process-gpu` trades away crash
  containment, so real Windows appends nothing whatever the user has stored,
  and an explicit `safeMode:'on'` still wins for the Wine user who wants it
  (the card WARNS there rather than explaining). The access violation is
  unidentified: this is a workaround to re-measure when Wine or Electron moves.

## Cloud (feedback backend + future web) — state as of 2026-08-04

- **AWS**: dedicated sub-account `eqcompanion` **001634075447** (org
  management = `jmoyers` 383185690517), region **us-east-1**. CLI: profile
  `eqc` assumes `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` via source profile
  `windows-desktop-eqc` (owner-managed key). Terraform + AWS CLI installed
  via winget. Full detail: docs/agents-archive.md.
- **Terraform**: root `infra/`, state in s3 bucket
  `eqcompanion-tf-state-dae027bf` (versioned, BPA) + lock table
  `eqcompanion-tf-lock`. Deploys run from this machine with
  `AWS_PROFILE=eqc`; CI only fmt/validate/bundle. **Standing authorization
  (owner, 2026-08-05): NON-DESTRUCTIVE applies and migrations — additive
  DDL, copy-first backfills with count verification, Lambda updates — may
  be run by the agent directly. Anything that drops, overwrites, or loses
  data (including "empty" shells until counts are VERIFIED) still gets
  explicit owner approval first.** The 30-resource stack applied 2026-08-04.
- **Store is Aurora DSQL** (owner: "I hate dynamodb"), not DynamoDB:
  schema in `infra/schema.sql`, applied by `triage-feedback migrate`
  (never yet run against a live cluster — it stops on and prints a bad
  statement). Ingest connects as a DB role holding **INSERT ON report and
  nothing else**; IAM tokens, zero passwords. DSQL laws: no FKs/triggers/
  PLpgSQL, fixed Repeatable Read + OCC (retry only SQLSTATE 40001),
  3,000-row txn cap (bounds every sweep), one DDL per txn,
  `CREATE INDEX ASYNC`, jsonb young + unindexable (we use text).
- **F2: DEPLOYED AND LIVE (2026-08-04)** — submit/idempotency/oversize
  live-verified, kill switch OPEN, constants in net.ts. Two DSQL live
  findings encoded: grants on the system-owned `public` schema are
  unsupported, and `statement_timeout` cannot be SET (client-side
  query_timeout only; db.ts). Verification detail + the SNS confirmation:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
- **ANALYTICS COHORT SPLIT — LIVE (2026-08-05, waves R+S, run under the
  standing authorization).** The migration ran COPY-FIRST per owner ruling
  (staging tables, row-count AND sum(n) verification, swap via DSQL's
  documented `RENAME TO`; nothing dropped until its verified copy existed).
  Runbook: infra/README.md "THE COHORT MIGRATION". **A ROTATED analyticsId
  arrives unmarked — re-run `analytics owner-add`**; cohort mechanics live
  in the USER/OWNER SPLIT bullet below.
- **ANALYTICS OPERATIONS (how usage questions get answered):**
  - Daily/adoption truth: `triage-feedback analytics digest --days N
    --profile eqc` (user cohort by default; `--cohort all` prints both,
    NEVER summed). Series history STARTS 2026-08-04 — there is no earlier
    data and never will be.
  - Live concurrency: CloudWatch `EQCompanion/Telemetry` `Heartbeats`,
    `Channel=prod`, **Sum over 600s** ≈ concurrent sessions. **THE PERIOD
    IS THE CLIENT'S HEARTBEAT CADENCE, NOT A CHOICE** (JOS-269 took it
    5 min → 10 min). `liveSessions.ts BUCKET_MS` is the same number and the
    two move together or the readout silently lies.
  - Install truth is `analytics_install`; GitHub `download_count` is NOT
    installs (the auto-updater dominates it). DAU can slightly exceed
    installs across UTC day boundaries — artifact, not phantom users.
  - The kill switch is cached in warm Lambdas for 60s — a 503 right after
    `analytics open` is the cache, not a failure.
  - **THE PULSE'S LIVE HALF IS A CLOUDWATCH READ, NOT A COUNTER** (JOS-39):
    `liveSessions.ts` reads `Heartbeats` directly, merged at the two
    presentation edges — never inside `buildAnalytics`, which stays pure.
    The average age is labelled `est.`, can only under-claim, and is NULL —
    never 0 — when nobody is alive.
  - **`upgrades` IS DERIVED SERVER-SIDE**, once per version change;
    downgrades count; disjoint from `newInstalls`. Pre-marking counter rows
    carry no id and stay in the user cohort forever — read old days with
    that in mind.
- **Local dev story**: `scripts/dev-feedback-server.mts` — same contract,
  same shared validator, failure knobs; the app reaches it via
  `EQ_FEEDBACK_URL`, honored ONLY behind `!app.isPackaged` (packaged builds
  must prove the env var does nothing).
- **Usage analytics**: opt-OUT (owner decision over the integrator's opt-in
  recommendation) but NOTHING transmits before the first-run notice renders;
  allowlist schema; separate rotatable analyticsId; payload viewer +
  TELEMETRY.md (plan: docs/plans/usage-analytics.md). A1/A2/A3 are ALL LIVE:
  a second Lambda (`eqcompanion-telemetry-ingest`) behind `POST
  /v1/telemetry`, aggregating on arrival into the three tables — NO
  raw-event store — plus EMF metrics, a dashboard, `analytics
  digest|wipe|open|close`, and the Triage → Analytics tab. **The endpoint is
  LIT**: `TELEMETRY_API_URL` is a compiled-in constant;
  tests/telemetryNet.test.mts pins the exact URL, the single fetch site, and
  the consent gates (nothing before the notice; opt-out destroys buffer +
  id). Full detail: docs/agents-archive.md.
  **THE CADENCE IS A COST DIAL, THE CONTENT IS NOT (JOS-269, owner ruling
  2026-08-12).** `FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS` 5 min and `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS`
  10 min (flush.ts). Every event is a counter delta that sums server-side,
  so batching harder loses NOTHING; every flush is one request through API
  Gateway + Lambda + DSQL, which is the whole bill. The priced cost: a
  KILLED session's duration coarsens to its last heartbeat. **THREE NUMBERS
  ARE DERIVED FROM THESE AND MUST MOVE WITH THEM**: `liveSessions.ts
  BUCKET_MS` (= the heartbeat, or Live halves), the "sessions in the last
  10 min" tile note, and the sandbox smoke's `$telemetryDwellSec` (must
  exceed ONE flush tick — nothing leaves the machine except on one;
  `stopTelemetry` writes the ring, it does not POST). Changing WHAT is
  collected is a different decision and remains owner law. Full note:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
  **THE ADDITIVE-FIELD RULE (JOS-39, and it is a deploy-skew law).** The app
  auto-updates itself; the ingest Lambda is deployed by hand — so a shipped
  client is regularly talking to an OLDER copy of the shared contract. A NEW
  EVENT KIND is fatal under that skew: the shared validator fails the whole
  batch, the endpoint answers 400, and `telemetryPermanentRefusal` (net.ts)
  classes 400 as "these bytes will never be accepted" and DROPS the batch — so
  the client throws away every counter it is carrying, on every flush, until
  the deploy lands. A NEW OPTIONAL FIELD on an existing kind is free: the
  validators CONSTRUCT their result field by field, so an older server simply
  does not copy it across and accepts the batch. Add measurements as fields
  (`linesParsed` rides on `sessionHeartbeat`/`sessionEnd`), and the client half
  is then safe to ship BEFORE the additive apply.
  **USER/OWNER SPLIT (2026-08-05, owner-directed, LIVE).** Every counter row
  carries a `cohort` ('user'|'owner'), IN the PRIMARY KEY of
  `usage_daily`/`usage_funnel_daily` and a nullable column on
  `analytics_install`. Dev builds tag themselves SERVER-SIDE from
  `env.channel` (no client change, no TELEMETRY.md change); the installed
  copy is marked by hand with `analytics owner-add <analyticsId>`. Every
  read defaults to the user cohort; `--cohort all` renders both SIDE BY SIDE
  and nothing ever sums them. Rows aggregated before a marking keep their
  cohort and the digest says so.
## Known open items

- **Toolchain (JOS-63, landed 2026-08-06)**: electron 43.2.0 / vite 7.3.6 /
  electron-vite 5.0.0. Still open: ~150MB of other-platform onnx binaries in
  the installer (trim via asarUnpack filters; koffi's excluded prebuilds are
  the worked example). History: docs/agents-archive.md.

- **Feedback loop**: planned in `docs/plans/feedback-triage.md`; F1/F2 have
  since SHIPPED (see Cloud above) — the plan is historical intent now.
- Azure signing: waiting on Microsoft identity validation → cert profile +
  app registration + repo secrets.
- Windows Sandbox: WORKING (last run 2026-08-03, PASS, gating v0.2.0) —
  `run-installer-test.ps1` is the standard pre-ship clean-machine gate.
- Design docs for shipped 2026-08-03 features live in `docs/plans/` —
  historical intent; the code + this file are the current truth.
- Startup could be TAIL-FIRST (attach the live tail, backfill history
  backwards): needs order-independent folding in every module — a real
  architecture change, not yet attempted; the `hydrating` flag keeps today's
  ~6s replay honest meanwhile.
- Not yet parsed: Dragon Hoard / tradeskill depot / combine loot lines.
  Group-member combat tracking: future scope.
- **Open chips (2026-08-05, full briefs in the chips + docs/agents-archive.md):**
  the combo swap-back blind spot — the hardest inference fix in the repo, do
  not rush it (PARTLY CLOSED by JOS-79: `reinstatedDrops`; a swap between
  capped classes still dings for nothing and remains evidence-only); the e2e
  per-checkout lockfile; copyText still serializing the melee-rounds footer
  the Rounds panel replaced.
- **Awaiting real samples** (the outputs registry refuses them typed until
  a committed fixture graduates each): /outputfile guild, raid, spellbook,
  factions, achievements, alternateadv — one in-game `/outputfile <kind>`
  from anyone provides it. Same law for the **Double Bow Shot annotation**
  (JOS-92): `You shoot` remains ZERO in the whole log, so the FIRST-PERSON
  archery arm is the shape still awaiting a sample (the Ranged lane is built
  on other players' third-person bow lines). Sweep detail:
  docs/agents-archive.md.
- Releases this arc: v0.4.0-v0.6.0 shipped sandbox-gated + smoke-verified;
  per-release detail in `shared/releaseNotes.ts` and docs/agents-archive.md.
