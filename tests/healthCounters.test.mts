// ============================================================================
// healthCounters.test.mts — the client half of JOS-96: what the app COUNTS.
// ============================================================================
//
// `EvHealthCounters` had been in the contract since wave A2 with NO PRODUCER — the schema, the
// validator, the fold and TELEMETRY.md all described five counters that nothing ever incremented.
// This suite covers the code that finally does.
//
// ITS PARTNER IS `tests/releaseHealth.test.mts`, which covers the readout these counts feed, and
// the two halves are one argument: the drain's "report even a clean session" decision below exists
// SOLELY to make that panel's "not reporting" state possible. They are two files only because both
// halves together are past the repo's 400-code-line ceiling — a split, not a widened threshold.
//
// `src/main/telemetry/health.ts` imports NOTHING (see its header: `errorLog.ts` is one of the five
// sources and `collector.ts` imports `errorLog.ts`, so a counter living in the collector would
// close a cycle on the app's error path). The happy consequence is that this suite drives the REAL
// production counters with no Electron in the process — no mocks, no fixtures, no clock.
//
// WHAT CAN GO WRONG HERE, and each gets a test: the delta could double-count across the two drain
// points; a clean session could report nothing and so make a healthy build look like a build that
// predates this code; a burst could be clamped into a lie; an opt-out could leave counts waiting;
// and a call site could drift away from the place the design argument put it.
