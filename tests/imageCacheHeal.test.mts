// ============================================================================
// imageCacheHeal.test.mts — a cached image that will not read back (JOS-266).
// ============================================================================
//
// THE READING THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR: `image cache: could not read <path>` arrived in the error
// store as a new family — ~290 occurrences across 0.20–0.23, the largest fingerprint
// 8f0e7721ddcad03b at 198 on one build — and the exemplar carries `code=ENOENT`. A file that
// `existsSync` had just confirmed was gone by the time `readFile` opened it: antivirus taking the
// folder, a cleaner emptying it, a permission changing under a running app. The app's answer was to
// file an error and show the user nothing.
//
// TWO CHANGES, ONE DECISION, and this suite drives both because neither is worth much alone:
//   * IT HEALS. The entry is evicted (userData only) and the request falls through to the same
//     fetch a never-cached image takes, so the outcome is the picture, a beat late.
//   * IT IS A WARNING. One console line per failure CODE per session plus the
//     `imageCacheReadFailures` counter, instead of an errors.log line and a `mainErrorLogLines`
//     tick — so the error store stops counting a self-healed read as an error.
//
// WHAT IS DRIVEN AND HOW. The whole `eqimg://` handler, for real: Electron is INJECTED
// (`installImageCacheProtocol` takes a `protocol` and the userData dir), the fetch is injected, and
// the two sinks are injected — so this runs the production request path with no Electron, no
// network and no fixtures, exactly as `tests/imageCache.test.mts` runs the pure half.
//
// THE UNREADABLE ENTRY IS A DIRECTORY, and that is the honest limit of what a test can stage: the
// wild failure is ENOENT (a race with something else deleting the file) and EPERM (a scanner
// holding it), and neither can be produced deterministically on either platform from inside Node. A
// directory sitting where a file should be fails the read the same way at the same line — `EISDIR`
// rather than `ENOENT` — which is what this suite pins, and the branch does not read the code for
// anything but the one warn line. The EVICTION, which a directory cannot demonstrate (unlinking one
// fails, deliberately harmlessly), is pinned as source at the bottom.
