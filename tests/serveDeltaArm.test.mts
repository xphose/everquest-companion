// THE CURSOR ARM, THE MARK COMMAND AND THE SERVED FACT (JOS-493, pruned by JOS-499).
//
// THIS FILE USED TO BE ABOUT ARBITRATION BETWEEN TWO WORLDS. With `EQC_ENGINE_SERVE=1` a
// renderer hydrated its snapshot from the RUST ENGINE and then rode `module:delta` out of the
// TypeScript fold, so `knownSeq` and `delta.seq` were unrelated numbers and every increment was
// dropped as a dupe. Twelve of its claims were about telling those two worlds apart — which hook
// rides which channel, what the `served` flag decides, what a flag-off launch pushes, which half
// gates a command. THE SECOND WORLD IS DELETED, so those claims are not weakened, they are
// unstatable: there is nothing left to arbitrate.
//
// WHAT SURVIVES IS EVERYTHING THAT WAS NEVER ABOUT THE ARBITRATION — the two channels being
// distinct names on both bridges, the world-change id colliding with no module, the racing-cursor
// guard, the unsubscribe discipline, the fan-out reaching the same windows the rebuild does, the
// mark carrying the instant main already stamped, and the served-mtime graft being quoted rather
// than re-derived (owner ruling 21).
//
// THE DEFECT THESE PINS EXIST FOR, in one sentence: with `EQC_ENGINE_SERVE=1` a renderer hydrated
// its module snapshot from the RUST ENGINE and then rode `module:delta` out of the TypeScript fold,
// so `knownSeq` and `delta.seq` were unrelated numbers and every increment was dropped as a dupe
// (MEASURED at engine seq 4 against app seq 3 on a respawn watch; STRUCTURAL for the four modules
// that publish a private revision counter — combo, character, respawn, buffTimers).
//
// WHAT CAN BE PINNED HERE AND WHAT CANNOT. The behaviour end to end needs a real engine, a real
// socket and two renderers, and it is claimed by `tests/e2e/engine-shim.e2e.mts` and the
// engine-on suite. What a node suite CAN hold is the set of structural properties the fix rests on,
// each of which would compile, ship and fail silently if it regressed:
//
//   1. THE TWO CHANNELS ARE DISTINCT and both bridges expose the second one under the SAME name —
//      `tests/sessionMarks.test.mts` pin 3's argument, and the same failure mode: a second name for
//      one signal is how the two windows end up folding two different worlds.
//   2. EACH FOLDER RIDES EXACTLY ONE OF THEM, and the SNAPSHOT decides which. A hook that read a
//      flag instead would hold a stale opinion the moment the shim fell back mid-session.
//   3. THE MARK IS STILL ONE INSTANT. The engine's command must carry the number main already
//      stamped — a second clock read here would be a third boundary. AND ITS SIBLING CARRIES NONE
//      (JOS-494): `respawn.confirmSighting` names a ROW, because the instant it re-bases onto is
//      one the fold already holds — so the pin there is the params shape and the ORDER, which is
//      the mark's "both halves or neither" applied to one half.
//   4. THE SERVED FACT IS QUOTED, NEVER RE-DERIVED (owner ruling 21). The shim grafts the mtime the
//      ENGINE reported; a `statSync` in that file would prove nothing about who owns the fact.
//
// SOURCE PINS in `tests/fightSelection.test.mts`' technique — comments are stripped first, because
// this repo explains itself in prose that would otherwise satisfy its own greps. They are source
// pins rather than behavioural ones because every module involved reaches Electron: the hooks are
// renderer React, `serveShim.ts` imports the error log, and `serveDeltas.ts` imports the pipeline.
//
// Imported RELATIVELY: node tests run through tsx with no `@shared` alias.
