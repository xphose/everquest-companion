// prefsHydration.test.mts — a control never paints a value it does not know (JOS-340).
// ============================================================================
//
// The Preferences pane reads a store that lives in MAIN, over a bridge on which every method is a
// promise. Every card used to mount on its compiled-in default and correct itself from an effect,
// so the first painted frame of a switch was always the default and the user's own value arrived
// a hop later. The fix is one hydration gate for the whole pane plus a snapshot the renderer keeps
// warm — src/renderer/src/features/preferences/prefsSnapshot.ts, whose header carries the design.
//
// TWO HALVES, AND THIS FILE IS THE ONE A NODE TEST CAN SEE.
//
//   1. HERE: the snapshot mechanics. That the batch is ONE batch (a gate that fired eighteen reads
//      per mount would be a different bug), that concurrent mounts share it, that a failure does
//      not become permanent, and — the load-bearing one — that a WRITE updates the cache, because
//      that is what makes the SECOND mount of a card correct after the user has changed something.
//      A frozen-at-load snapshot would pass every other test in this file and fail that one, which
//      is precisely why the fix is a live cache rather than a preload injection.
//
//   2. NOT HERE: whether a real MUI Switch is born with the right `checked`. That is a claim about
//      a FRAME, and no assertion in this process can see one. `tests/e2e/prefs-first-paint.e2e.mts`
//      makes it against the running app with a MutationObserver, because a settled read of this
//      defect is green on the broken build — the settle is exactly what hides the flash.
//
// The reader is a STUB, and it counts its own calls. Nothing here touches Electron, `window`, or
// the store: `prefsSnapshot.ts` takes the bridge as an argument for this reason.
