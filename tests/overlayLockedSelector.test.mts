// A LOCKED OVERLAY KEEPS ITS SELECTOR — and, since JOS-138, a scroll grip (P3 of
// docs/plans/combat-overlay-parity.md; owner ruling 3: "a LOCKED overlay keeps its top dropdown
// usable; click-through everywhere else", plus the owner's 2026-08-09 disposition that a pinned
// overlay must still scroll).
//
// This is a SOURCE pin rather than a behaviour test on purpose: the thing being protected is a
// wiring decision across three files plus a main-process hazard note, and none of it can be
// observed without a real always-on-top window and a real cursor (the e2e harness asserts the
// IPC half of the seam instead — see tests/e2e/overlay-sync.e2e.mts).
//
// THE HAZARD IT GUARDS, AND THE FACT THAT IT IS NOW GONE (JOS-370).
// `setIgnoreMouseEvents(true, {forward:true})` installs a low-level mouse hook (WH_MOUSE_LL) owned
// by MAIN, so every system mouse event waited on our message loop and a blocked main froze the
// user's cursor system-wide. P3 was implemented by REUSING that already-paid-for forwarding on the
// meter kinds rather than by adding a second sensor — which was the right call while the hook
// existed, and is why the pins below could always be stated as "no NEW hook".
//
// The hook is now gone from the application outright: a locked overlay is `setIgnoreMouseEvents(
// true)` with no second argument anywhere, and the capture that reveals its pin is flipped by an
// off-thread cursor hit test against published rectangles (src/main/overlayHotZone.ts). So the
// first pin below is stronger than it was — the count it asserts is ZERO — and the rest are
// unchanged, because the RENDERER half of P3 did not move: the named reasons, the header sensor,
// the grip and the one channel they all ride are exactly what they were.
