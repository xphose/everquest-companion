// WHO COUNTS AS EVERQUEST, AND WHO MAY MOVE THE FOREGROUND (JOS-199).
//
// Two v0.18.0 reports, one subsystem, and they pull the same lever from opposite ends.
//
// 1. THE COMPANION IS NOT EVERQUEST. "Overlays dont hide when EQ Companion is open and in the
//    foreground. They hide properly when any other app is up and above everquest… the overlays
//    cover a lot of the Companion unnecessarily when trying to navigate through the app."
//    (report 01KZPVWXZACDHVRNKTFGDW3E4M.) The own-windows rule was one bit — `pid === process.pid`
//    ⇒ EQ side — which is right for an overlay you are dragging and wrong for the app itself.
//    `foregroundSide` splits it, and the tests below are that matrix.
//
// 2. AUTO-HIDE MUST NEVER MOVE THE FOREGROUND WINDOW. "when the Overlay is set to Hide when you're
//    not in everquest, Alt tabbing from EQ will bring you back to EQ the first time but with
//    hidden overlay, then you can alt tab again to move to new windows. but if you click into EQ,
//    alt tab will continue to bring you back ANY TIME THE OVERLAYS ARE VISIBLE."
//    (report 01KZPTD3MHP3DFG7NJY5QF96VJ.)
//
//    THE MECHANISM is `BrowserWindow.setFocusable`, and it is documented rather than mysterious:
//    Electron spells it "changes whether the window can be focused" and notes "on macOS it does
//    not remove the focus from the window" — i.e. on WINDOWS it does. `setFocusable(false)`
//    deactivates the window, and Chromium's deactivate walks the Z-ORDER and hands the foreground
//    to the first VISIBLE window below it. Our overlays are always-on-top directly over the game,
//    so that window is EverQuest.
//
//    `setOverlaysHidden(true)` re-asserted each overlay's locked mode on the way DOWN, and the
//    locked mode IS `setFocusable(false)`. So: alt-tab away, the focus debounce commits ~300 ms
//    later, the hide pass deactivates five still-visible topmost windows, and the user is standing
//    back in EverQuest. The reporter's final clause is the confirmation — Chromium's deactivate
//    returns early on a window that is not visible, which is exactly why the alt-tab taken while
//    the overlays were already hidden worked and the next one did not.
//
// WHY HALF OF THIS IS A SOURCE PIN. The classifier is pure and is tested as one. The alt-tab half
// is a Win32 foreground transition inside a real always-on-top window stack: it needs a game to
// sit under it, a second app to alt-tab to, and windows the e2e mode (src/main/e2e.ts) never shows
// at all. Nor is there a predicate hiding in it — the fix is that a CALL is no longer made on a
// path, which is a property of the call graph. So the call graph is what gets asserted, the same
// bargain tests/cursorRingOff.test.mts strikes for the cursor gate's three assignments.
