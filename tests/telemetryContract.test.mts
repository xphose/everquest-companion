// THE PROPERTY THIS SUITE EXISTS TO PIN is not "the validators work". It is that the schema
// CANNOT EXPRESS A NAME. Plan decision T2: "the schema structurally cannot express character
// names, zone/mob/spell/item names, log text, or anything typed". A privacy promise enforced by
// remembering to strip things is a promise that will be broken by the fifth person to add an
// event; a privacy promise enforced by the type having no slot cannot be.
//
// So the load-bearing tests here are the negative ones: an event carrying an extra property
// comes back WITHOUT it, every string-typed field is a member of a closed set declared in the
// file, and the buckets refuse a raw value dressed up as an index.
//
// No Electron, no fixtures, no network: this suite never skips.
