// THE CLOSED RESULT REGISTRY, APP SIDE (src/shared/dataServer/ops.ts).
//
// The schema states a rule it deliberately refuses to put on the wire: a reply carries no op of its
// own, because the op of the REQUEST whose id it names is what decides the result shape. That rule
// is not expressible in the generated types — `ReplyResult` is a bare union there — so `ops.ts` is
// where it becomes one, and this file is where the claim is checked against the committed
// conversation rather than against itself.
//
// IT EXISTS BECAUSE THE REGISTRY IS A CLAIM ABOUT THE ENGINE, not a derivation from it. `ParamsFor`
// is read straight off the wire union and cannot drift; `ResultFor` is written down by hand, so the
// only thing standing between "the registry says session.health answers with a HealthResult" and
// reality is a test that makes the engine answer. `OpsAreExhaustive` covers the other half at
// compile time — a new op in `protocol/schema/` is a TYPE error in ops.ts until somebody writes
// down what it answers with — and the runtime half is here.
//
// JOS-478 added `module.snapshot`, the first data-bearing op, which is why this file exists now
// rather than at JOS-468: it is the first op whose result shape a caller actually reads a value
// out of.
