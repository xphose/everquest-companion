// THE HOOKLESS HOVER SENSOR (JOS-370), in test form — the half that is a function of its
// arguments.
//
// WHAT THIS FEATURE IS. A locked overlay used to be `setIgnoreMouseEvents(true, {forward:true})`,
// and on Windows that `forward` installs a low-level mouse hook (WH_MOUSE_LL) owned by the MAIN
// process: a low-level hook is a SYNCHRONOUS stop on the machine's mouse path, so every mouse event
// on the desktop — the ones EverQuest reads to turn the camera included — waited on our message
// loop. Any hitch of ours was a freeze of the user's cursor, and past `LowLevelHooksTimeout`
// Windows silently unhooked us and the hover pin quietly stopped working. The hook bought exactly
// one thing: mouse MOVES, so a pinned window could tell when to take the mouse back for its pin.
//
// It is replaced by asking the question from the other side: main names the RECTANGLES a pinned
// overlay still wants the mouse in, the presence worker hit-tests the cursor against them on its
// own thread, and only the enter/leave EDGES cross the wire.
//
// THREE PROPERTIES ARE WORTH PINNING HERE, because each is a promise a reviewer would otherwise
// have to take on trust:
//
//   1. THE ZONES MIRROR THE SENSOR EACH KIND'S RENDERER ALREADY RUNS. A meter that published its
//      whole window would take back exactly the click-through P3 exists to protect ("a LOCKED
//      overlay keeps its top dropdown usable; click-through everywhere else").
//   2. NOTHING IS WATCHED IN A STATE WHERE CAPTURE WOULD BE WRONG. A parked overlay is on screen at
//      opacity 0, and handing an invisible rectangle the mouse is a click-eater over whatever the
//      user just alt-tabbed to.
//   3. THE CODEC REFUSES JUNK IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. The downstream half is new — main now talks to
//      the watcher as well as listening to it — and the rule the upstream half has always had
//      applies unchanged: a malformed line decodes to NOTHING rather than moving the state.
