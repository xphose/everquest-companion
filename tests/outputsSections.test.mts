// ============================================================================
// A SECTION IS A SHAPE, NOT A NAME — the `/outputfile inventory` tables (JOS-185).
// ============================================================================
//
// Its sibling `tests/outputsInventory.test.mts` pins the parser against the REAL dumps. This file
// pins the one rule those dumps cannot exercise, because neither of them contains a third table:
// how a section the client has never shown us is read.
//
// EVERY DUMP BELOW IS SYNTHETIC AND SAYS SO. No sample of a Dragon's Hoard table exists in this
// repo or anywhere on the internet — the CONDITION is documented everywhere ("Dragon's Hoard items
// if the Dragon's Hoard window is open", eqlwiki.com/Commands) and the SHAPE is documented
// nowhere, which is exactly why the parser stopped keying on names. So these tests assert the RULE
// and never a token: the section is called `Hoard` here only to demonstrate that its name is not
// what makes it readable, and a real dump calling it anything at all passes these same assertions
// unchanged. `tests/fixtures/` stays real bytes only — nothing invented is committed as a fixture.
//
// The defect that earned the rule: report 01KZNQK6ZSRB8SMN8D5PJ8BS28, whose Plane of Sky weapons
// sat in the hoard. eqlposky.com read them out of his dump; this app said he had none, because a
// section it could not name went to `unknownSections` and never reached held counts.
//
// Run: `npm test`.
