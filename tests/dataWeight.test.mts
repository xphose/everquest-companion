// The committed data-weight ledger (src/shared/dataWeight.ts, JOS-458).
//
// WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR, and it is the entire reason a GENERATED ledger is allowed to exist here.
// The per-file numbers are measured by `scripts/gen-data-weight.mts` on a reference box and
// committed, because every corpus is an ES import inlined into the bundle (there is no file at
// runtime) and re-parsing 11 MB to price it would cost ~250 ms of blocked main — the exact defect
// JOS-458's G2 forbids. That trade is only honest if a stale ledger CANNOT SHIP. This file is what
// makes that true, the same contract `telemetryDoc.test.mts` has with its generator:
//
//   1. EVERY LISTED FILE STILL EXISTS AND IS STILL THAT SIZE. A data change that skips the
//      generator turns this red rather than shipping a ledger that lies about the release.
//   2. EVERY CORPUS OVER THE FLOOR IS LISTED. A NEW 8 MB file dropped into `src/main/data` is
//      caught here, not noticed a year later.
//   3. THE GAP IS NAMED. Corpora over the floor that main does not load are in `rendererOnly`
//      rather than silently absent — a ledger that covered half the shipped data and said so
//      is a measurement; one that covered half and didn't is a wrong answer.
//
// It reads real files (a few megabytes of `stat`, no parsing), so it is fast and never skips.
