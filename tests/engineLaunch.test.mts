// THE LAUNCH BANNER'S ARITHMETIC AND ITS PROSE (JOS-503) — `src/shared/engineLaunch.ts`.
//
// WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR. Two things a component must not be trusted with, hoisted into a pure
// module so they can be driven directly:
//
//   1. THE ESTIMATE. An ETA is the only thing on the banner that is not a measurement, so the
//      interesting assertions are all about REFUSING to give one — too few samples, too short a
//      span, a rate that has not moved, a mark that went backwards because a new fold started.
//      Every one of those is a real frame sequence and every one of them would, if it produced a
//      number, put an authoritative countdown in front of a user that was invented.
//   2. THE WORDS. Every failure class is read here, so a class that ships with an empty sentence
//      fails the build rather than reaching somebody's screen as a blank card. `engine-absent.
//      e2e.mts` asserts the SAME strings from the DOM, which is what stops the spec and the product
//      agreeing about different sentences.
//
// NOTHING HERE READS A CLOCK. `FoldSay.at` is passed in, so every case below is integer arithmetic
// with nothing sleeping in it — the same discipline `views::Timeline` keeps engine-side.
