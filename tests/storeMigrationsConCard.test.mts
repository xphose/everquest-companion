// The con card's arrival in a store that has never heard of it (JOS-383).
//
// A companion to `storeMigrations.test.mts` and its siblings (`…Toast` 9, `…Presence` 5,
// `…Telemetry` 6, `…Perf` 7, `…Voice` 4+8, `…EqNote` 13), for the same reason those are separate
// files: the first is at the repo's 400-code-line factoring ceiling, and the answer to that is a
// split rather than a widened threshold.
//
// WHY THERE IS NO MIGRATION HERE, AND WHY THAT DESERVES A TEST OF ITS OWN.
//
// This is the first overlay kind ever to ship ON that was not already stored somewhere, and "ships
// ON" is exactly the shape that has needed a migration once before: the celebration toast's 8 -> 9
// step exists because `overlays.toast` was ALREADY WRITTEN as `false` in every store that had run
// the previous day's build, so changing the default alone would have left it off forever.
//
// `overlays.conCard` has never been written by any build. A DEFAULT decides the value of an ABSENT
// key, so every store on earth — a fresh install, a v1 file from the first commit, and the fully
// populated current-schema fixture below — reads `DEFAULT_OVERLAY_CONFIG.conCard` and gets the card, with
// nothing rewritten and no stored value reinterpreted. The claims below are that the chain stays
// out of it entirely, and that the shipped default is the ON the owner asked for.
//
// The store's own reader (`getOverlayConfig`) is not importable here — it is `electron-store` —
// so the default is asserted from the DECLARATION in main/store.ts, read as text. That is the same
// instrument `overlayLockedSelector.test.mts` uses on the click-through gate, and for the same
// reason: the fact under test is a one-line policy statement, and the alternative is an e2e launch.

/**
 * `store-v15-con-card.json` — a store at TODAY's schema: three overlay kinds configured (a meter,
 * the toast and the alert banner, each with its own blob) and no `conCard` key anywhere, because
 * no build has one to write.
 *
 * IT IS RE-PINNED WHENEVER THE SCHEMA MOVES, and the pinning is the point. The first claim below
 * is that a CURRENT store does not run the chain at all — which is what makes "a new overlay kind
 * is not a schema change" a fact about this build rather than about the day it was written. When
 * JOS-385 added the `resists` blob at v14, the v13 copy of this fixture stopped being current and
 * became what it should be: the input to THAT step's own test (storeMigrationsResists.test.mts).
 * The journal history upgrade similarly retains that v14 file and pins this copy to v15.
