/**
 * telemetryProducers.test.mts — the half of usage analytics that JOS-39 built: the code that
 * DECIDES what a producer reports, pinned without Electron and without a cluster.
 *
 * The producers themselves (src/main/session.ts, src/main/updater.ts, src/main/ipc/speech.ts) are
 * wiring: they call one of these functions at a moment in their own lifecycle, and the moment is
 * what tests/e2e/telemetry.e2e.mts asserts against the running app. What lives here is everything
 * that can be wrong ARITHMETICALLY or SEMANTICALLY:
 *
 *   * `classifyFailure` — an error message reduced to one of five words, against the REAL strings
 *     the two failure producers emit (copied from speech/provision.ts and electron-updater);
 *   * the once-ever funnel ledger's data model (`allFunnelStepMarks` + the prefs normalizer);
 *   * `linesParsed` — that the optional field survives validation, is dropped when absent, and
 *     folds into the `linesParsed` counter from BOTH events that carry it.
 *
 * Why the failure classifier gets a test of its own: it is the one place in this feature where a
 * STRING is read, and its whole job is to make sure no part of that string can leave. A wrong
 * class is also actively misleading — "12 checksum failures" sends an operator to look at a CDN —
 * so each arm is pinned against a message that really occurs, not against an invented one.
