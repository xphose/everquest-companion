// JOS-337 — THE WIKI CARRIES A SPELL THE GAME DOES NOT HAVE, AND THE OVERLAY LEARNS TO SAY SO.
//
// `src/main/data/spells.json` is a SCRAPE and `scripts/scrape-spells.ts` rewrites it wholesale, so
// a hand-DELETE out of it is undone by the next re-scrape exactly the way a hand-EDIT is. JOS-150
// built the edit half (`spellCorrections.ts`); this is the delete half, and
// `src/main/data/spellRemovalsList.ts` carries its evidence bar — which is NOT the corrections bar
// and cannot be, because the corrections bar is a line count and absence cannot be counted.
// READ THAT HEADER FIRST. This suite is the guard that keeps the layer from becoming a way to
// delete rows nobody checked.
//
// WHAT IS PINNED HERE:
//
//   1. THE ACCEPTANCE, BY NAME. The corrections layer gets an anti-rot guard for free — every
//      entry restates the text it replaces, so a wiki that moves reports `stale`. A removal has
//      nothing to restate: a misspelled name and a naturally-dropped page are indistinguishable at
//      run time, and the layer deliberately calls BOTH of them `satisfied` (see THE TOMBSTONE).
//      That decision has a price and this is where it is paid: every entry is asserted BY NAME
//      against the committed DB, so a typo is caught in the commit that writes it rather than
//      never.
//   2. THE SHAPE OF THE BAR. A dated verification, an explicitly-stated (or explicitly-null)
//      mechanical reason, and evidence — checked as DATA, because a bar that lives only in prose
//      is a bar the next entry can quietly skip.
//   3. THE CONTRADICTION. A spell cannot be both removed and corrected. The load order makes that
//      fail on its own (a correction naming a removed row reports `unknownSpells`); this refuses
//      the pair STATICALLY too, so the report names the real defect.
//   3b. THE DUPLICATE PAGE (JOS-440). `supersededBy` is a second, narrower claim — "the wiki
//      documents this spell twice and this page is the copy EQ Legends is not running" — and it is
//      held to its own obligations here: the named survivor must be in the effective DB after
//      removals AND corrections, and it is allowed to be a row a `name` correction renames INTO the
//      removed spelling. That last permission is a NARROWING of a rule this suite used to state as
//      a blanket refusal; the argument, and the two assertions that still cover the hazard the
//      blanket rule was written for, are beside the test.
//   4. IDEMPOTENCE, NON-MUTATION, AND THE RE-SCRAPE — both directions, the way
//      tests/spellCorrections.test.mts asks them of every correction.
//   5. THE RIPPLE. The layer exists because a phantom spell is OFFERED to the player, so the
//      tests that matter are the two surfaces that were offering Invigor: the New-at-this-level
//      panel (`buildLevelUnlocks`) and the suggested-alerts catalog (`buildSpellCatalog`).
//
// NO REPORTER BYTES AND NO THIRD-PARTY SPEECH ENTER THIS FILE. The measurements quoted in the list
// file's header were taken over the owner's own log and are stated there as counts; nothing here
// needs a log line at all, because the whole subject is a row that should not exist.
//
// Run: `npm test`.

// 6 — THE SEAM AUDIT: nothing indexes the scrape in front of the overlay
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Every `src/` module that ES-imports the scrape MUST route it through the removals seam, or be
 * named here with the reason it does not.
 *
 * WHY A GREP AND NOT A TYPE. AGENTS.md states the standing hazard in one line — "a raw-spells.json
 * importer that looks up BY NAME is a silent miss waiting to happen" — and JOS-161 paid for it
 * once already (`spellClasses.ts` and `levelUnlocks.ts` had to be retrofitted after the rename).
 * The import is the only thing a compiler can see; a new consumer that forgets the overlay type-
 * checks perfectly and is wrong.
 *
 * THE THREE EXEMPTIONS ARE REASONED, NOT GRANDFATHERED, and the third one is a rule about what
 * this layer MEANS rather than a concession.
 *
 * The first two build a name -> boolean ROSTER and both deliberately UNION the raw and corrected
 * spellings of every name, because the parser only ever sees the log's spelling and a membership
 * test must answer to both (charmModel.ts learned that one the hard way and says so in place). Two
 * consequences: passing them a shortened list would change nothing, since the raw list is unioned
 * in regardless — and charmModel.ts additionally walks `raw[i]`/`corrected[i]` in INDEX LOCKSTEP,
 * which a pass that deletes rows would silently break. Neither roster is a catalog anybody is
 * shown; the worst a stale member can do is keep the parser willing to recognize a spell nobody
 * can cast, which is inert.
 *
 * THE THIRD IS `effectIndex.ts`, AND IT MUST STAY ON THE RAW LIST. It joins an ITEM's `Effect:`
 * line to the spell page of the same name, to borrow the one-liner a gear row prints (type,
 * target, duration). A removal says "no player can learn this spell"; it does NOT say "no item
 * carries this effect", and for Invigor the committed items corpus settles it: SEVEN items carry
 * an `Invigor` effect, among them Frozen Efreeti Boots, Tolan's Darkwood Boots and Mrylokar's
 * Greaves. Feeding this join the shortened list would blank the one-liner on seven real,
 * obtainable items in order to hide a spell scroll — a regression bought with a fix. The boundary
 * is worth stating once, here: this layer removes what the app OFFERS the player, never what the
 * app can DESCRIBE.
 *
 * AND THE FOURTH IS THE SAME JOIN, ONE TICKET LATER (JOS-452). `wornFocusIndex.ts` takes an item's
 * `Focus Effect:` line to the spell page of the same name to read the percentage and the level cap
 * off it. It is `effectIndex.ts`'s join with a different field harvested, so it inherits that
 * argument whole: a removal states that no player can LEARN a spell, and no player learns a focus
 * effect - every one of the 68 focus pages in the catalog reads `classes: No eligible class`. The
 * two names the removals layer carries today (`Invigor`, `Invisibility Versus Undead`) are not
 * focus effects and neither is anything the layer could plausibly grow, so routing this join
 * through the seam would buy nothing and would risk blanking a focus the player is really wearing.
