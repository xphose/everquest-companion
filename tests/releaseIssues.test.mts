// ============================================================================
// releaseIssues.test.mts — TOP ISSUES BY VERSION, the readout half of JOS-100.
// ============================================================================
//
// `tests/releaseHealth.test.mts` (JOS-96) covers the error RATE per build: how much, normalized,
// and the not-reporting / true-zero distinction the whole section rests on. This covers the half
// a rate cannot be — WHICH issues, out of `error_report`, with one exemplar each.
//
// A SEPARATE FILE for the reason its sibling's own header gives for existing: both together are
// past the repo's 400-code-line ceiling, and the answer to that here is a split rather than a
// widened threshold. The seam is real — nothing below reads a counter row for anything except
// establishing which builds exist.
//
// THE THREE THINGS THAT COULD GO WRONG, and each has a test:
//   1. THE FOLD. `error_report` is keyed per DAY, so one long-lived issue is several rows.
//      Counts must add, the seen-span must widen, and the FIRST exemplar must win — the same
//      rule the ingest UPSERT applies within a day, extended across them, so what a reader sees
//      does not change as later days accumulate.
//   2. ATTRIBUTION. An issue belongs to the build it was reported from. A panel that showed a
//      previous release's crashes against the new one would be worse than no panel at all.
//   3. THE MISSING EXAMPLE. A count with no exemplar is still a fact and must still be listed;
//      an exemplar that is no longer schema-legal must be REFUSED rather than rendered.
//
// Pure over hand-authored rows, like its sibling: no AWS, no Electron, no fixtures, no clock.
// This suite never skips.
