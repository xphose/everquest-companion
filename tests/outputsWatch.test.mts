// THE `/outputfile` WATCHERS, AGAINST A REAL DIRECTORY (JOS-431).
//
// Every other half of the outputs registry is pure and is pinned without a disk
// (tests/outputsRegistry.test.mts). This half cannot be: the subject IS what chokidar reports when
// a file on a real filesystem is written, deleted and written again, and a fake that answers with
// the events we hope for would pass on exactly the day the real one stopped sending them. So this
// file drives a temp directory and asserts on the handlers the registry hangs its behavior off.
//
// THE REPORT (01M0FMGA4DQRMG46290GWVVHQ6, v1.6.0). The player re-ran `/outputfile inventory` and
// the app kept showing a days-old timestamp until it was restarted. The file was demonstrably
// fresh — their log named the write to the second and the attached dump's mtime matched it — so
// the miss was ours, and it was here: `watchOutputFile` subscribed to `change` ALONE. An in-place
// rewrite is a `change`; a rewrite that REPLACES the file is `unlink` followed by `add`, and both
// of those were dropped without a listener to hear them.
//
// SO THE THREE EVENTS ARE THREE PROMISES, and they are asserted separately because the registry
// uses them for three different things: `change` is the ordinary rewrite, `add` is the file coming
// back, and `unlink` is the signal to re-arm on whatever is there now.
//
// AND WHAT THE DISK ACTUALLY SAYS, MEASURED HERE RATHER THAN ASSUMED — it is not what the ticket
// predicted, and the difference is why the code is shaped the way it is:
//   * On this platform a delete-and-recreate reaches a SINGLE-FILE watcher as a `change`, because
//     chokidar re-arms on the file's return by itself. That path is conditional inside chokidar
//     and platform-specific, so it is exactly the kind of thing that holds on a dev machine and
//     not on a reporter's; the file watcher now listens to all three events and stops depending
//     on which one arrives.
//   * On a DIRECTORY watcher the same fast replace collapses into one `change` on a file it never
//     stopped tracking, and only a deletion it has processed turns the return into an `add`.
// The directory watcher therefore keeps its one job — an APPEARANCE — and does not subscribe to
// `change`: the file watcher already covers rewrites, and a second subscription to the same event
// would double every reload the app performs.
//
// WHY THE WAITS ARE GENEROUS. `awaitWriteFinish` holds every add/change until the size has been
// stable for 400 ms (watch.ts), so the honest floor for one assertion is half a second and the
// ceiling is whatever a loaded CI machine does to a poll interval. These waits are for a failure
// to be a FAILURE rather than a flake; a passing run does not spend them.
//
// Run: `npm test`.
