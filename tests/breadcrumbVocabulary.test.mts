//
// Split out of `tests/errorReportContract.test.mts` (JOS-501) when it pushed that file past the
// repo's 400-code-line ceiling, and it is a cut on the file's own seam rather than a widened
// threshold — the same answer, for the same reason, that produced
// `tests/errorReportLocation.test.mts`.
//
// WHAT IT GUARDS, and why it is worth a file. The breadcrumb ring is the one part of an error
// report that says what the app was DOING, and it has a producer on one side of the process and a
// contract on the other. JOS-499 moved the producer (the parser left; the engine's cursors
// arrived) and did not move the contract, so `errorReports.ts wireCrumbs` — a FAIL-SAFE filter
// that drops what the contract does not admit — discarded every crumb on every report the deletion
// release shipped. `breadcrumbs: []`, in silence, for a whole release.
//
// The filter is not the bug and must not be made strict: dropping one crumb is much better than
// failing a real crash report. What was missing is a test ABOVE it, comparing what producers emit
// against what the contract admits. That is this file.
//
// No Electron, no network, no fixtures — it reads the engine's Rust sources as text, which is the
// same thing `tests/enginePackaging.test.mts` does with electron-builder.yml. It NEVER SKIPS.
