// THE ARTIFACT HANDOVER (JOS-497 item 2, boundary verdict 4) — ONE OWNER AT ANY INSTANT.
//
// JOS-496 landed the engine's ability to read and write `resist-ledger.json` and
// `message-overlay.json` at the app's own paths in the app's own byte-verbatim formats, and
// deliberately did not throw the switch: sending `stateDir` while `src/main/resist/store.ts` and
// `src/main/data/overlayPersistence.ts` still persisted would have put two processes on one file
// with two cadences. This file is the proof that the switch, now thrown, cannot produce that state.
//
// WHY THE ORDERING CLAIM IS THE ONE WORTH A TEST. "The app stops before the engine starts" is not
// something a call site can be trusted to honour by writing two statements in the right order — the
// next hand to touch `sendAttach` would have no way of knowing the order mattered. So the ordering
// is enforced by `attachStateDir`'s own body: it moves the latch and only THEN produces the path,
// which means the string that tells the engine where the files are cannot be obtained by a process
// that is still writing them. The tests below hold exactly that shape rather than the sentence.
//
// AND IT IS A UNIT BECAUSE THE HAZARD IS A TIMING ONE. Two processes racing a file at a
// sixty-second cadence is not a thing an e2e can stage inside its five-minute cap; the state
// machine that makes it impossible is four lines and is checkable exhaustively. `artifactOwner.ts`
// therefore imports nothing at all — the userData path and the log sink both arrive as arguments —
// which is what lets this run with no Electron in the room.
