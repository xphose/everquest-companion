// ============================================================================
//
// THE READING THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR, and it is one number: 7,272,196. That is how many occurrences
// of ONE fingerprint one 0.14.0 install filed in a single day — `Error: EPIPE: broken pipe, write`,
// frames `logError` ← `process.<anonymous>`. Those two frames are the whole bug: the app answered a
// failed console write by writing to the console, and the failed write of the answer was another
// uncaught exception. Nothing in the client was in a position to stop it, because nothing bounded
// how many times an issue may be reported.
//
// TWO FIXES, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME FIX:
//
//   A. THE LOOP, at its source. A pipe with no reader is not a fault in this app, so a write to it
//      fails silently and latches (`src/main/deadPipe.ts`), and the `'error'` listener that was
//      missing on `process.stdout` / `process.stderr` — the absence of which is what PROMOTED a
//      dead audience into an uncaught exception — is installed.
//   B. THE SHAPE, in general. A hard per-fingerprint per-session ceiling on every reporting path
//      (`src/main/errorBudget.ts`), because the next thing that learns to fail on a timer will not
//      be this one, and the client must not be able to report it without bound either.
//
// WHAT IS DRIVEN AND WHAT IS PINNED. Both new rules are LEAVES — they import nothing — so this
// suite runs the real production code with no Electron in the process, `tests/errorNoise.test.mts`'s
// technique for its reason. `noteError` is driven for real too (it imports only pure `shared/`
// code). The WIRING inside `logError` and `crashGuards` needs Electron, so it is pinned as source.
