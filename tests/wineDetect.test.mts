// Wine detection (src/shared/wineDetect.ts) — JOS-31.
//
// THE ASYMMETRY IS THE WHOLE SUITE. A false negative costs one Wine user an automatic fallback
// they can still reach by hand (two switches, an env var, a support reply). A false positive costs
// EVERY Windows user their hardware acceleration and their see-through overlays, for a problem
// they do not have. So the negative cases here are adversarial and the positive cases are plain —
// and the last test asks the REAL machine this suite is running on, which is a Windows box, and
// requires the answer 'no' with the actual filesystem underneath.
//
// What this suite CANNOT do is prove the positive against a real prefix: nothing here has run
// under Wine, and the claim that a stock prefix carries `wineboot.exe` in system32 rests on Wine's
// documented layout. The fixtures below describe that layout; the reporter verifies it.
//
// Pure module, injected probe, no Electron and no filesystem except in the last test.
