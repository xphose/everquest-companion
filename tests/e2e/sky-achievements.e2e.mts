/**
 * Headless Electron integration test for THE ACHIEVEMENTS DUMP MARKING SKY QUESTS (JOS-429).
 *
 * THE REPORTS, four wordings of one question: 01M0GH44G2F0EB1CH83RR7NT5Z ("There doesn't seem to be
 * a way to import what Plane of Sky achievements I've already completed"), 01M00NET9PEG9MEB1J5BT7KBJQ
 * ("sky quests -- process /outputfile achievements to close completed quests"),
 * 01M0BF54C4159KG7S19QNBQ4VZ, and Fountsy on Reddit ("if i forgot to turn logs on and did a bunch
 * of sky raids... how would I import that data?"). The turn-in ledger knows log-detected trades,
 * hand statements and the legacy key — and a player who did Sky on another PC, before installing,
 * or with logging off has none of them.
 *
 * THE ANSWER, argued in full in shared/outputs/achievements.ts and
 * renderer/features/posky/achievementInference.ts: `/outputfile achievements` carries one
 * `Obtain <Item>` row per Sky quest reward with a status the SERVER decided. That is not an
 * inference from a bag; it is the answer, and it outranks the reward inference it composes with.
 *
 * WHY THIS NEEDS A REAL APP. The parse and the join are pure and pinned without a browser
 * (tests/outputsAchievements.test.mts, tests/achievementInference.test.mts). What no unit test can
 * see is the CHAIN, and it is longer than issue #27's: an achievements file in the EQ install root
 * → the outputs registry finds and stats it → `parseAchievementsDump` → `classUnlockClaims` →
 * main's store → the `progress:changed` push → `useProgress` → the join → the ladder → the badge,
 * the disabled undo, and the freshness line on the row a user is actually looking at. JOS-87 is
 * this repo's standing reminder that a chain like that breaks at a seam every unit test is happy
 * with — and TWO of these seams are new (a second graduated kind, and a second derived source).
 *
 * THE FIXTURE PAIR IS WHAT MAKES THE CLAIM CLEAN, and both halves are committed:
 *   * `e2e-copy.log` carries ZERO loot lines and ZERO completed trades, so the turn-in ledger is
 *     empty on this launch and no inventory export is staged. Every badge below therefore has
 *     exactly one possible source.
 *   * `Primitive_freeport-Achievements.txt` is the owner's own real dump, and it marks 48 of the 95
 *     Sky quests `C` — of which 44 COUNT and four do not, because they sit under the one class the
 *     owner confirmed and the server cascaded the grant into their rows (JOS-441). MEASURED over the
 *     committed pair (tests/achievementInference.test.mts asserts the same 44 and names the same
 *     four from the other side), so both numbers are assertions about the join rather than numbers
 *     to trust.
 *
 * THIS IS THE TICKET'S ACCEPTANCE CRITERION RUN END TO END: the owner's own achievements file,
 * loaded by the real app, marks their completed Sky quests — and the second launch proves the other
 * half, that a file with no sky rows changes nothing.
 *
 * WHY IT NEVER TAKES THE SCREEN: `EQ_E2E=1` (src/main/e2e.ts) shows no window, skips the
 * single-instance lock, and points `userData` at a throwaway temp dir per launch.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e -- sky-achievements`.
