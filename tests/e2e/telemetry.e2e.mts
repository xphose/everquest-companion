/**
 * Headless Electron integration test for USAGE ANALYTICS (docs/plans/usage-analytics.md, A1).
 *
 * WHY IT IS AN E2E SPEC AND NOT A UNIT TEST: every promise this feature makes is a SEAM.
 *   - "the notice is shown before anything could be sent" crosses the store, a migration, an
 *     IPC handler, App.tsx and a MUI Snackbar. Only the real app can show the bar appearing on
 *     a genuinely fresh userData.
 *   - "Opt out persists" is a claim about a FILE surviving a process, so it is asserted the
 *     only way that means anything: two launches against the same userData dir.
 *   - "this run sends nothing" holds for dark builds and configured releases: `EQ_E2E=1`
 *     keeps this spec silent independently of its build-time endpoint. The pane explains
 *     whether an endpoint exists, and `lastBatch` remains null in both cases.
 *   - "the schema cannot carry a name" is asserted against the REAL buffer this session filled
 *     by switching tabs, not against a constructed sample.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: reach the network. `EQ_E2E=1` shuts the flush gate on its
 * own (plan T7), so no flush timer is ever created — and the assertions below prove the visible
 * consequence: nothing was ever sent from any of these four launches.
 *
 * Identities only, never today's numbers: the buffer is asserted to GROW and to contain only
 * schema-legal events, never to hold N of them.
 *
 * Run: `node --import tsx tests/e2e/telemetry.e2e.mts` (it is also in tests/e2e/run-all.mts).
