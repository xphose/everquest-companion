/**
 * Headless Electron integration test for the Combat dashboard (Task #56).
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS: unit tests replay fixtures through the engine, but the bug that motivated
 * this harness ("the Combat tab is JUST a scrolling combat log") was invisible to them — it
 * lived in the RENDERED LAYOUT, downstream of a perfectly correct snapshot. This drives the
 * REAL app end to end (real main process, real historical scan, real renderer bundle) and
 * asserts what the user actually sees.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS (wave E2): `tests/fixtures/e2e-combat.log`, a committed slice — two credited
 * kills, three zone changes, three loot lines — staged into a throwaway EQ install and handed to
 * the app through `EQ_INSTALL_DIR`. Not the owner's live log: the same bytes on every machine,
 * so "the dashboard has no rows" can only ever mean the dashboard has no rows. The LIVE half is
 * scripted too — the harness appends a ten-hit, 442-point pull to the tailed copy and asserts
 * that exact total (tests/e2e/gameplay.mts), where this spec used to wait 45 s for the owner to
 * be fighting and then assert a floor.
 *
 * WHY IT NEVER TAKES THE SCREEN: the app is launched with `EQ_E2E=1` (see src/main/e2e.ts),
 * which (a) never calls show()/showInactive() on ANY window — the main window is already
 * created with `show:false`, so it is created, laid out and rendered offscreen but never
 * mapped or focused; (b) skips the single-instance lock so this instance runs happily beside
 * the user's dev app instead of quitting; (c) selects the 'e2e' channel in src/main/channel.ts,
 * which points `userData` at a throwaway temp dir (never seeded from the user's state) so the
 * real store / errors.log are untouched. The user can keep playing while this runs.
 * Layout still happens in a hidden window, which is exactly what we measure.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS: hydration completes (replay → live tail), then, against whatever the real
 * log contains right now: the dashboard is present AND HAS HEIGHT (the regression), the
 * source meter has rows, the DPS-over-time, Procs and Damage-by-mob cards exist (JOS-37: the
 * dedicated You breakdown preview retired and Procs took its cell), the Fight/Overall
 * SCOPE filters the selector to exactly one scope's rows (Task #60 — a fight meter must never
 * wander into the zone aggregate), the header holds its two-rank shape (subject line, then
 * lens line) with the Timeline view offered only when the selection actually has an event
 * ring, and the combat log is a BOUNDED scrolling box.
 * Assertions are identities/floors — never "today's numbers" (AGENTS.md: frozen numbers rot).
 *
 * On any failure: the relevant DOM + a screenshot land in tests/e2e/artifacts/ (gitignored).
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e`
