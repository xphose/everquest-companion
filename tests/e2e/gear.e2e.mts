/**
 * Headless Electron integration test for the GEAR tab (JOS-284, phase 3 of the gear planner).
 *
 * WHY ITS OWN FILE: one spec per surface, all of them sharing `appHarness.mts` and running back to
 * back from `npm run test:e2e`. `EQ_E2E=1` (src/main/e2e.ts) shows no window, skips the
 * single-instance lock and points `userData` at a throwaway temp dir, so this runs invisibly
 * beside the user's game and dev app.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS, against the REAL committed item corpus and through the REAL IPC: the nav row
 * mounts a table with no plan and no selection first (search is the WHOLE surface since JOS-325 —
 * owner ruling); the list is its own bounded scroller; the search box narrows it and finds a named
 * item; the era toggle actually holds rows back; a MULTI-SELECT slot filter and a weapon type
 * COMBINE; a header click sorts by ratio and the order is monotone; and — the one this phase exists
 * for — moving the GLOBAL plus-state selector makes the table state the numbers `scaleGearRow`
 * states at that state.
 *
 * AND SINCE JOS-302 IT ASSERTS THE THREE NARROWINGS THE OWNER ASKED FOR. The class picks REMOVE
 * rows rather than chipping them (and a search row no longer wears `planner-mismatch-chip` at all),
 * a second slot is a UNION rather than a replacement, and the weapon-type picker's categories are
 * exactly the union of their member types — measured as an identity between two counts, never as a
 * number. The class and weapon steps live in `gearFilterSteps.mts`; the slot half is this file's
 * own slot step, grown.
 *
 * WHAT IT NO LONGER ASSERTS, because the code is gone: the stat-threshold chip flow, the
 * threshold-derives-its-own-column rule, and the min-ratio box (JOS-302's fourth owner ask). Those
 * three steps were REMOVED rather than weakened; what replaced them is the slot/weapon combination
 * above, and an upgrade step that names its three columns in the picker instead of conjuring two of
 * them out of a filter it never actually wanted.
 *
 * THE FIXTURE IS THELVORN, and its numbers are not written here. The spec imports phase 0's own
 * scaler and asks it, so this file can never drift from the arithmetic it is checking: what it
 * pins is that the SCREEN agrees with `scaleGearRow`, at base and at the owner's checkpoint. The
 * base vector is copied from `tests/gearIndex.test.mts`, which asserts it against the corpus — so
 * a rescrape that changes Thelvorn turns THAT file red first, naming the corpus rather than the UI.
 *
 * AND SINCE JOS-285 (phase 4) IT ASSERTS THE OWNERSHIP JOIN, which is the half no unit test can
 * see. `tests/gearOwnership.test.mts` owns every WORD the join produces, without a DOM; what needs
 * a real app is the CHAIN — a `/outputfile inventory` dump staged into the install root → main's
 * outputs registry finding and stating it → the fold → one IPC payload → a map keyed by `row.key`
 * → a cell on a windowed row — plus the second witness, the LIVE log, arriving by a completely
 * different route (an appended loot line → the tailer → the loot module → a delta) and landing on
 * the same key. Two processes, two transports, one join key: that is what this spec is for.
 *
 * The dump is the committed `Primitive_freeport-Inventory.txt`, and the two rows it is read for
 * were chosen because they are the join's two interesting cases in the OWNER'S OWN file:
 * Thelvorn is equipped at +5 (with its own exaltation socketed beside it, which must NOT read as
 * a second copy), and `Guise of the Deceiver` sits on the `Activated` key ring the fold does not
 * count — the exclusion the header of the Owned column has to admit to.
 *
 * WHAT IT NO LONGER ASSERTS, TAKE TWO: THE SETS (JOS-325). JOS-286 added three steps and a whole
 * step module (`gearSetSteps.mts`) for a chain three transports deep — a `+` on a windowed search
 * row → a cell in a pane → the `sumGear` totals → a debounced write over IPC → main's validator →
 * electron-store → a second launch that read it back. The owner retired the sets surface, so those
 * claims are RETIRED WITH IT rather than weakened: a removal legitimately removes its own
 * assertions, and a spec that kept asserting a `+` nobody can click would be pinning a bug.
 *
 * What did NOT go with them is anything about search, and that is the constraint this ticket was
 * written under: every step below — mount, rows, era, ownership cells, the owned filter, search,
 * class picks, slot union, weapon types, ratio sort, the global plus-state, the columns picker and
 * its relaunch — is exactly the spec JOS-302/JOS-324 left. The SECOND LAUNCH survives too, for the
 * column choice rather than for the sets: `ProgressState.gearSets` is kept on disk (progressState.
 * ts) and no longer has a surface to prove itself through, so `tests/gearSetStore.test.mts` is now
 * the only thing that speaks for it — which is the right level, because the store round trip is
 * all that is left of the feature.
 *
 * AND SINCE JOS-338 IT ASSERTS THE COMPARISON CARD, which is the first popper this tab has ever
 * mounted and therefore the first place the JOS-143 defect could come back. The step
 * (`gearCompareSteps.mts`) opens the card on a real row, reads the equipped half against the same
 * staged dump the ownership steps read, and then — with the card OPEN — hit-tests the toolbar, the
 * row's wish control and the item name's Loot link. That last part is the regression, stated the way
 * the owner met it twice: not "is a popper on screen" but "does the click still land".
 *
 * …AND SINCE JOS-344 IT ASSERTS THAT A HUMAN CAN SEE IT. The version above shipped a card drawn
 * three pixels inside the right edge of the window: present, correct, and invisible. So the step
 * takes the WINDOW now (it narrows it past the app's own minimum and puts it back) and measures the
 * two cards' boxes against the viewport at both sizes. Its header carries the measurement and the
 * two traps in taking it.
 *
 * AND SINCE JOS-329 IT ASSERTS THAT THE FORM COMES HOME. The owner's report was that the whole gear
 * area lost its state on every module switch, so the two round trips he described are steps here:
 * set six controls to values nothing defaults to, leave for the Loot MODULE and come back; then
 * drill into the Loot detail from a row and press BACK. Both compare a fingerprint read off the
 * SCREEN — including the count line, which moves if any narrowing was silently dropped — and both
 * assert the view UNMOUNTED first, because a spec that skipped that would pass on the one build
 * where the bug cannot happen (AGENTS.md, JOS-90/97/116). The second launch then proves the
 * RESTART SPLIT in both directions: the slot pick and the era toggle survive the process, the typed
 * search does not.
 *
 * The one thing it deliberately does NOT assert is a row count: the corpus grows (AGENTS.md,
 * "frozen numbers rot"), so every count here is a floor or an identity.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e -- gear`.
