// EXALTATION PLANNER — what you are WEARING, joined into the planner's slots (V7).
//
// The Inventory tab fills each cell's host from the character's own `/outputfile inventory` dump,
// and the join between the two vocabularies is a HAND-AUTHORED TABLE (law 12: cross-source
// renames are knowledge, never fuzzy) — `Fingers` vs `FINGER`, and `Any Slot`, which has no wiki
// counterpart at all and gets a CELL instead of a slot (JOS-104). A fuzzy matcher here would put a
// ring on a finger by luck and a two-hander somewhere
// embarrassing by the same luck, so the table is pinned three ways: it is TOTAL over the client's
// closed token set, it maps onto real planner slots only, and it produces the right answer on the
// real 295-line dump.
//
// Same fixture the outputs engine uses (`tests/fixtures/Primitive_freeport-Inventory.txt`, the dev
// character's real dump, committed verbatim). Pure: no Electron, no fs beyond that read.
