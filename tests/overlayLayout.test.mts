// Default overlay placement (Task #59 follow-up: UNIFORM default size).
//
// This is pure geometry — no log, no fixture, so it never skips. It pins the two properties the
// first-open layout has to have on any display, and the one product rule behind them:
//   1. EVERY METER kind opens at the SAME width x height (user decision). No per-kind sizes.
//   2. The reserved slots never overlap and never leave the work area — with uniform sizes the
//      bottom-right stack wraps into a new column instead of running off the top of the screen.
// Persisted bounds are not exercised here: they short-circuit this module entirely in
// createOverlayWindow (index.ts prefers `cfg.bounds` and only calls in here when there are none).
//
// THE TOAST IS THE ONE KIND OUTSIDE ALL OF THAT (docs/plans/celebration-toasts.md §3). It is a
// transparent celebration strip, not a meter: its own width, TOP-CENTRED, and holding no slot
// in the bottom-right stack — so the meter assertions run over METER_KINDS and the toast gets
// its own geometry test below. Adding it must not have moved any meter's reserved slot, which
// is what the last test in this file checks.
//
// JOS-119 ADDED THE SEVENTH METER KIND ('debuffs') and with it the case rule 2 could no longer
// satisfy at a fixed size: seven 380x320 slots do not fit a 1366x728 work area under ANY column
// arrangement (three columns and two rows is six). So the uniform size is now a function of the
// display — it shrinks, all kinds together, until the reserved grid fits — and rule 1 is stated
// PER WORK AREA. `uniform on this display` is the property; `always 380x320` never was one that
// could survive a seventh window, and the alternative was two windows opening on top of each
// other, which is the thing this file exists to forbid.
